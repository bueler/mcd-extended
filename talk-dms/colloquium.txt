title:  Fast solvers for partial differential equations subject to inequalities

speaker:  Ed Bueler, DMS UAF

abstract:

This talk, about recent joint work with Patrick Farrell of Oxford University, may be suitable for a general mathematical audience.  It is at the intersection of scientific computing, optimization, and partial differential equations (PDEs).  FIXME

Free boundary problems for PDEs are described by variational inequalities, which generalize the problem of optimizing in infinite-dimensional convex sets.  For this class of problems I'll describe the first full approximation storage (FAS) nonlinear multigrid methods for solving the finite element (FE) discretizations of th.  Geometrically, these methods decompose the convex admissible set over a hierarchy of finite element meshes.
Motivation for applying FAS to VIs is demonstrated in the standard mathematical model for glacier surface evolution, a very general VI problem relevant to climate modeling.  (Residuals for this nonlinear and non-local VI problem are computed by solving a Stokes model.)  Some existing nonlinear multilevel VI schemes, based on global (Newton) linearization would seem to be less suited to such general VI problems.  From this context I will sketch some work-in-progress toward the scalable solutions of nonlinear and nonlocal VIs by an FAS-type multilevel method.
