title:  Fast solvers for partial differential equations subject to inequalities

speaker:  Ed Bueler, DMS UAF

abstract:

This talk, about recent joint work with Patrick Farrell of Oxford University, is at the intersection of scientific computing, optimization, and partial differential equations (PDEs).  It may be suitable for a general mathematical audience.

Free boundary problems for elliptic PDEs are precisely described by variational inequalities.  These continuum problems generalize the problem of optimizing well-behaved functions over infinite-dimensional convex sets.  For the finite element discretizations of such free boundary problems I'll describe the first fully-nonlinear multigrid (multilevel) methods.  Geometrically, these new "full approximation storage constraint decomposition" methods construct a decomposition of the convex admissible set, on the finest mesh, over a hierarchy of sub-meshes.  The run time of these algorithms is observed to be proportional to the number of degrees of freedom, which will exceed 100 million in some of my examples.

One motivation for considering such free boundary problems arises from the standard mathematical model for glacier surface evolution, a problem central to climate modeling.  Classical examples will also be demonstrated, include the obstacle problem for an elastic membrane and a (linearized) problem of flow through a porous medium.
