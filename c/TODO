to complete single-level PNGS implementation:
* separate CR calculation into function Vec = GetCR(Vec u, Vec f, ObsCtx* user)
* optionally write residual in ascii_matlab using SNESGetFunction() and VecView()
* optionally write CR in ascii_matlab using GetCR() and VecView()
* check that residual and CR look good
* rewrite in terms of Vec containing defect constraint
* should I build dcsl.c which does both classical obstacle and SIA exact soln?
* move on to NMCD!!
