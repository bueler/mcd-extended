to complete single-level PNGS implementation:
* rewrite in terms of Vec containing defect constraint: dcsl.c
* should dcsl.c include both classical obstacle and SIA exact soln?
* move on to NMCD: + PNGS must be capable as smoother at any level
                   + add NMCD which is plugged in as highest-level NGS
