TITLE: Toward nonlinear multigrid for nonlinear variational inequalities

SPEAKER: Ed Bueler

ABSTRACT:  I will start with two brief surveys, each with solver demonstrations (in PETSc).  First is a class of problems, namely variational inequalities (VIs), which generalize PDE problems.  Second is a class of solver algorithms, namely full approximation storage (FAS) multigrid for PDEs.  Motivation to apply the latter to the former comes from the standard mathematical model for glacier surface evolution, a very general VI problem.  (Residuals for the nonlinear and non-local operator in this problem must be computed by solving a Stokes model.)  Existing multilevel VI schemes--also briefly surveyed--seem unlikely to apply to such general VI problems.  From this context I will sketch some work-in-progress toward the scalable solutions of such problems.
