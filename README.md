This project's original goal was the "extend the multilevel constraint decomposition method of Tai (2003)", which explains the repository name.  It turned out that the new method is called _full approximation scheme constraint decomposition_ (FASCD).  It is implemented in Python using the [Firedrake]() finite element library at [Patrick Farrell's `fascd` repository](https://bitbucket.org/pefarrell/fascd/src/master/).

The paper itself is complete and published:
