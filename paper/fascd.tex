\author{Patrick E.~Farrell}

\date{\today}

\begin{abstract}
We present the \emph{full approximation scheme constraint decomposition} (FAScd) multilevel method for solving variational inequalities (VIs). FAScd is a common extension of both the full approximation scheme (FAS) multigrid technique for nonlinear partial differential equations, due to A.~Brandt, and the constraint decomposition (CD) method introduced by X.-C.~Tai for VIs arising in optimization.  We extend the CD idea by recognizing and exploiting the telescoping nature of certain function space subset decompositions arising from multilevel mesh hierarchies.  Then, by applying strong smoothers, with work proportional to the number of unknowns on a finite element mesh level, we demonstrate that FAScd V-cycles exhibit excellent mesh-independent convergence rates and that FAScd F-cycles (full multigrid) are optimal solvers.  The example problems include unilateral and bi-obstacle VI problems with symmetric linear, nonsymmetric linear, and nonlinear differential operators.  Our examples demonstrate very good convergence even on problems where other multilevel VI solvers struggle.
%\pef{I want to say it's better than monotone multigrid. Is this too subtle/too much?}
% I vote for not saying this in the abstract.  It is hard to say which aspect of FAScd is more important to beating monotone multigrid: stronger smoother or improved up-smooth CD.  Probably the former, but for now we don't have any illuminating analysis.

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

The constraint decomposition (CD) methods of Tai \cite{Tai2003} are designed to solve coercive variational inequality (VI) problems arising as the Karush--Kuhn--Tucker optimality conditions for the minimization of a convex functional over a convex set.  These methods have been shown to converge for multilevel and domain decompositions in a finite element (FE) context; in the multilevel case, the CD method has been shown to have almost grid-independent error bounds, and near-optimal complexity, for elliptic, linear obstacle problems \cite[Subsection 5.4]{Tai2003}; see also \cite[Theorem 4.6 and Algorithm 4.7]{GraeserKornhuber2009}.  In this paper we extend the multilevel CD method by replacing the coarser-level corrections with a full approximation scheme (FAS; \cite{Brandt1977,Bruneetal2015}) approach, and we apply this new solver to nonlinear VI problems which do not arise from minimization.
%\pef{Note I've changed ``coarse-level corrections'' to ``coarser-level corrections'', to imply we're not just operating only on the coarsest grids, but also on intermediate grids.}
% Cool.

Specifically, our \emph{full approximation scheme constraint decomposition} (FAScd) method extends the algorithms in \cite{GraeserKornhuber2009} and \cite{Tai2003} in the following directions:
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{\emph{(\roman{enumi})}}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The FAS coarse corrections are adapted for general VI problems. The needed computations require neither an objective function nor linearity of the residual operator.
\item Box constraints, namely upper and lower obstacles, are permitted; see Section \ref{sec:femultilevel}.
\item We observe an asymmetry special to multilevel CD methods, namely that up-smoothing is more effective than down-smoothing because a ``telescoping'' subset property can be exploited on the up-smoothing side.
\item We implement V-cycles (Algorithm \ref{alg:fascd}) and F-cycles (full multigrid; Algorithm \ref{alg:fascd-fcycle}).
\item By using a Newton-type active set method as a smoother, with a fixed number of Krylov iterations per step so that the work of the smoother is proportional to the number of unknowns on the given level, we demonstrate that F-cycle FAScd is an optimal solver.
\pef{Clarify/limit which classes of problems we're claiming this for.}
\end{enumerate}

\pef{I think we need some text here hitting the nail on the head about what's different to monotone multigrid methods (even if it's just the absence of the invasive modifications of the basis functions).}

In our experiments, FAScd V-cycles exhibit essentially the same mesh-independent convergence rates for VI problems that FAS multigrid V-cycles exhibit for the corresponding (unconstrained) PDE problems.  The F-cycle results in Section \ref{sec:results} show nearly-textbook multigrid efficiency, namely solutions within discretization error in work comparable to few smoother sweeps on the finest-level mesh \cite{BrandtLivne2011}, for classical Laplacian obstacle problems, $p$-Laplacian obstacle problems, and nonnegativity-constrained advection-diffusion equations.  Furthermore, these results are essentially insensitive to the length or structure of the free boundary, i.e.~the geometric complexity of the coincidence set.

The iterates from FAScd are admissible, and thus the nonlinear operator in the VI needs only be defined for admissible states.  For example, we solve an ice sheet geometry problem (Examples \ref{ex:sia}, \ref{ex:results:sia}) in which the ice flow formulas are only meaningful for surface elevation iterates that do not penetrate the bedrock\footnote{More generally, fluid-layer problems, with a non-negative thickness constraint, often require the solution of an auxiliary PDE on a domain determined inside the VI residual evaluation \cite{Bueler2021conservation}.}.  Note that non-admissible methods, including semi-smooth methods \cite{BensonMunson2006}, would require unnatural and invasive modifications of the operator formula in such a fluid-layer context.  FAScd solves this low-regularity ice sheet problem, wherein the solution has unbounded gradient at the free boundary, with a mesh-independent number of F-cycle iterations.

This paper is organized as follows.  In Section \ref{sec:vi} we recall the theory of coercive and monotone variational inequalities, with several example problems.  Section \ref{sec:cd} reviews the basics of CDs, as proposed by Tai \cite{Tai2003}, and their induced iterations.  Section \ref{sec:femultilevel} sets up multilevel FE hierarchies, and then Section \ref{sec:cdmultilevel} presents defect constraints generated via monotone restriction operators \cite{GraeserKornhuber2009}.  Here we propose an apparently new understanding of telescoping sets for up-smoothing, based on an ``incomplete'' CD.  Section \ref{sec:vcycle} then states the FAScd V-cycle, with Section \ref{sec:implementation} addressing convergence criteria, F-cycles, and our smoother choice.  Section \ref{sec:results} gives FAScd numerical results from a parallel Firedrake \cite{Rathgeberetal2016} implementation for the problems introduced in Section \ref{sec:vi}.  The work concludes with discussion and outlook in Section \ref{sec:discussion}, and an appendix on how FAScd reduces to classical FAS multigrid for PDEs.


\section{Variational inequalities} \label{sec:vi}

Let $\cV$ be a real and reflexive Banach space with norm $\|\cdot\|$ and topological dual space $\cV'$.  Denote the dual pairing of $\phi \in \cV'$ and $v\in\cV$ by $\ip{\phi}{v} = \phi(v)$, and define the (Banach space) norm on $\cV'$ by $\|\phi\|' = \sup_{\|v\|=1} |\ip{\phi}{v}|$.  Let $\cK \subset \cV$ be a nonempty, closed, and convex subset, the \emph{constraint set}; elements of $\cK$ are said to be \emph{admissible}.  For a continuous, but generally nonlinear, operator $f:\cK \to \cV'$ and a linear \emph{source functional} $\ell\in \cV'$ we consider the following \emph{variational inequality} (VI) problem: find $u^\star\in \cK$ such that
\begin{equation}
\ip{f(u^\star)}{v-u^\star} \ge \ip{\ell}{v-u^\star} \quad \text{for all } v\in \cK. \label{eq:vi}
\end{equation}
Because $f$ is (generally) nonlinear, the source term $\ell$ is not strictly needed in stating this class of problems.  In fact, by redefining $f$ we may take $\ell=0$.  However, introducing $\ell$ clarifies the algorithm in Section \ref{sec:vcycle}.

VI \eqref{eq:vi} generalizes nonlinear systems of equations $f(u^\star)=\ell$ to problems where $u^\star$ is also constrained to be in $\cK$.  Informally, pretending the dual pairing is an inner product, \eqref{eq:vi} says that the angle between $f(u^\star)-\ell$ and any arbitrary vector $v-u^\star$ pointing from $u^\star$ into $\cK$ is at most $90^\circ$; while $f(u^\star)-\ell$ may not be zero, it must point directly into $\cK$.  On the other hand, if $u^\star$ is in the interior of the constraint set then \eqref{eq:vi} implies $f(u^\star)=\ell$.
Variational inequalities may generally permit multiple solutions~\cite{Farrell2019}.

The following definitions are standard \cite{KinderlehrerStampacchia1980}.

\begin{definition}  A map $f:\cK \to \cV'$ is \emph{monotone} if
\begin{equation}
\ip{f(u)-f(v)}{u-v} \ge 0 \qquad \text{for all } u,v \in \cK, \label{eq:monotone}
\end{equation}
\emph{strictly monotone} if equality in \eqref{eq:monotone} implies $u=v$, and \emph{coercive} if there exists $w \in \cK$ so that
\begin{equation}
\frac{\ip{f(u)-f(w)}{u-w}}{\|u-w\|} \to +\infty \qquad \text{as } \|u\|\to +\infty. \label{eq:coercive}
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

It is well-known that if $f:\cK \to \cV'$ is continuous, monotone, and coercive then VI \eqref{eq:vi} has a solution \cite[Corollary III.1.8]{KinderlehrerStampacchia1980}, and that the solution is unique when $f$ is strictly monotone.  As is standard in the calculus of variations \cite{Evans2010}, coercivity permits a compactness argument for unbounded sets $\cK$.  (Recall that the closed and bounded subsets of a reflexive Banach space are weakly compact.)  The condition of continuity can be weakened, e.g.~to only apply on finite-dimensional subspaces \cite{KinderlehrerStampacchia1980}, but this is unnecessary in our examples.

Some of the VIs solved in this paper satisfy a stronger inequality than \eqref{eq:coercive}.

\begin{definition}  Let $p>1$.  The map $f:\cK \to \cV'$ is \emph{$p$-coercive} if there exists $\kappa>0$ such that
\begin{equation}
\ip{f(u)-f(v)}{u-v} \ge \kappa \|u-v\|^p \qquad \text{for all } u,v \in \cK. \label{eq:pcoercive}
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

It is easy to see that if $f$ is $p$-coercive then it is monotone, strictly monotone, and coercive, so the following well-posedness theorem holds.

\begin{theorem}  \label{thm:viwellposed}  If $f:\cK \to \cV'$ is continuous and $p$-coercive then there exists a unique $u^\star\in \cK$ solving VI \eqref{eq:vi}.
\end{theorem}

Let $\Omega \subset \RR^d$ denote a bounded, open set with smooth or piecewise-smooth (e.g.~polygonal) boundary.  Sobolev spaces \cite{Evans2010} will be denoted by $W^{k,p}(\Omega)$, for integer $k$ and $1\le p \le \infty$, with $W^{1,p}_0(\Omega)$ denoting the subspace having zero boundary values.

The following example includes the classical and $p$-Laplacian obstacle problems \cite{ChoeLewis1991}.

\begin{example}  \label{ex:plaplacian}  Let $p>1$.  For $u,v \in \cV = W^{1,p}_0(\Omega)$, define $f:\cV \to \cV'$ by
\begin{equation}
\ip{f(u)}{v} = \int_\Omega |\grad u|^{p-2} \grad u \cdot \grad v\dx, \label{eq:plaplacian}
\end{equation}
a continuous map \cite[Theorem A.0.6]{Peral1997}.  For $p\ge 2$, if $x,y\in\RR^d$ then $(|x|^{p-2} x - |y|^{p-2} y)\cdot (x-y) \ge 2^{2-p} |x-y|^p$ \cite[Appendix A]{Bueler2021conservation}, hence it follows from the Poincar\'e inequality that
    $$\ip{f(u) - f(v)}{u-v} \ge 2^{2-p} a_0 \|\grad u - \grad v\|_p^p \ge 2^{2-p} a_0 C \|u-v\|^p$$
for some $C>0$, and thus $f$ is $p$-coercive.  The map \eqref{eq:plaplacian} is also coercive if $1<p<2$, but the proof is somewhat different \cite[Theorem 4.4, for example]{Bueler2021conservation}.  \end{example}

For monotone operators $f$, VI \eqref{eq:vi} generalizes the problem of minimizing a convex function over $\cK$.  In fact, suppose $F:\cK \to \RR$ is lower semi-continuous and (G\^ateau) differentiable with continuous derivative $F':\cK \to \cV'$.  Then $F$ is convex if and only if $F'$ is monotone \cite[Proposition I.5.5]{EkelandTemam1976}.  Furthermore, Proposition II.2.1 in \cite{EkelandTemam1976} shows that if $F$ is convex then \eqref{eq:vi} holds for $f=F'$ if and only if
\begin{equation}
u^\star = \argmin_{v\in\cK} F(v) - \ip{\ell}{v}. \label{eq:minimization}
\end{equation}
The CD methods of Tai \cite{Tai2003} address problem \eqref{eq:minimization}; the analysis in \cite{Tai2003} supposes that an objective $F$ exists with $F'$ 2-coercive.  For Example \ref{ex:plaplacian} we may define
\begin{equation}
F(v) = \frac{1}{p} \int_\Omega |\grad v|^p\dx. \label{eq:plaplacianobjective}
\end{equation}
Then $F$ is a convex functional and $F'(v) = f(v)$ for $f$ given in \eqref{eq:plaplacian}.  For any closed and convex $\cK\subset \cV$, VI problem \eqref{eq:vi} is then equivalent to optimization problem \eqref{eq:minimization}.

Next we give two examples which are \emph{not} of optimization type \eqref{eq:minimization}, the first being an advection-diffusion problem, which needs the following Lemma.

\begin{lemma}  \label{lem:advectionskew}  \cite{Elmanetal2014}\,  Suppose $\bX :\Omega \to \RR^d$ is a bounded and boundedly-differentiable vector field on $\Omega$ with zero divergence ($\Div \bX=0$).  For $u,v \in W^{1,2}(\Omega)$ let $b(u,v) = \int_\Omega (\bX \cdot \grad u) v\dx$.  Then $b(u,u) = \frac{1}{2} \int_{\partial \Omega} u^2 \bX\cdot \bn\dx$ where $\bn$ is the outward normal on $\partial \Omega$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Integration by parts gives $b(u,v) = - b(v,u) + \int_{\partial \Omega} uv \bX\cdot \bn\dx$.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}  \label{ex:advectiondiffusion}  Suppose $\partial\Omega$ is partitioned into Dirichlet and Neumann portions, i.e.~$\partial\Omega = \partial_D\Omega \cup \partial_N\Omega$, with $\partial_D\Omega$ of positive Hausdorff measure.  Let $\cV \subset W^{1,2}(\Omega)$ be the space of functions which are zero along $\partial_D\Omega$.  Consider a divergence-free velocity field $\bX$ on $\Omega$ satisfying the conditions of Lemma \ref{lem:advectionskew}, and assume that the flow is outward on the Neumann boundary: $\bX \cdot \bn \ge 0$ on $\partial_N\Omega$.  For $u,v \in \cV$, $\eps>0$, and $\phi \in \cV'$, define
\begin{equation}
\ip{f(u)}{v} = \eps \left(\grad u, \grad v\right)_{L^2(\Omega)} + b(u,v) - \ip{\phi}{v}. \label{eq:advectiondiffusion}
\end{equation}
%\pef{Why is $\phi \in L^\infty(\Omega)$? If that is the case, then should we have an $L^2$ inner product in the last term, rather than a dual pairing?}
% Fixed.  \phi can be in the dual space
With this operator, consider VI \eqref{eq:vi} with $\ell = 0$ for any closed and convex $\cK \subset \cV$. The interior condition, i.e.~PDE strong form, is the following linear advection-diffusion equation
\begin{equation}
-\eps \grad^2 u + \bX\cdot \grad u = \phi.
\label{eq:advectiondiffusionstrong}
\end{equation}
On the other hand, it is easy to see that $|\ip{f(u)}{v}| \le \left((\eps + \|\bX\|_\infty) \|u\| + \|\phi\|'\right) \|v\|$, thus that $f:\cK \to \cV'$ is continuous.  Lemma \ref{lem:advectionskew} says that the bilinear form $b(u,v)$ is skew-symmetric up to a nonnegative term.  By the outward flow assumption and the Poincar\'e inequality,
\begin{align*}
\ip{f(u)-f(v)}{u-v} &= \eps \int_\Omega |\grad u - \grad v|^2\dx + b(u-v,u-v) \\
                    &= \eps \int_\Omega |\grad u - \grad v|^2\dx + \frac{1}{2} \int_{\partial_N\Omega} (u-v)^2 \bX\cdot\bn \ge \eps C \|u-v\|^2.
\end{align*}
Thus $f$ is 2-coercive, and so the associated VI problem is well-posed.
\end{example}

If $\bX \ne 0$ then $f\ne F'$ for any objective $F$, because $\ip{f(u)}{v}$ does not possess the symmetry of the gradient of a scalar: for $u,v$ which are zero on $\partial \Omega$, note that $\ip{f(u)}{v} - \ip{f(v)}{u} = -2 b(u,v)$.  References \cite{Bueler2021conservation,ChangNakshatrala2017} consider inequality-constrained advection-diffusion VI problems like this, specifically over the set $\cK = \{v\ge 0\}$.

The next VI example is a model for steady ice sheet geometry in a given climate. It is nonlinear and not of optimization type. Related VI problems arise for any fluid layer which is subject to boundary processes that can remove fluid mass \cite{Bueler2021conservation}.

\begin{example}  \label{ex:sia}  Let $\Omega \subset \RR^2$ be a fixed region of land, and suppose $b \in C^1(\Omega)$ is a given bedrock elevation.  Let $a \in L^2(\Omega)$ denote a given ``surface mass balance'' function, the annually-averaged rate of ice accumulation (as snow) minus melt and runoff.  Then the surface elevation $s\in C(\Omega)$ of a steady-state, isothermal, and non-sliding ice sheet (glacier) approximately satisfies the following \emph{shallow ice approximation} (SIA) \cite{GreveBlatter2009} VI problem: find $s \in \mathcal{K} = \{s\ge b\}$ such that
\begin{equation}
\int_\Omega \Gamma (s-b)^{n+2} |\grad s|^{n-1} \grad s \cdot \grad (v-s) \dx \ge \int_\Omega a (v-s)\dx \quad \text{ for all } v \in \mathcal{K}, \label{eq:siavi}
\end{equation}
where $n>1$ and $\Gamma>0$ are constants determined by the physical properties of ice; $n=3$ is a typical value.  The doubly-nonlinear and doubly-degenerate operator in this case is
\begin{equation}
\ip{f(s)}{v} = \int_\Omega \Gamma (s-b)^{n+2} |\grad s|^{n-1} \grad s \cdot \grad v\dx. \label{eq:sia}
\end{equation}
If the bed is flat ($b=0$) then a power transformation converts the problem into $p$-Laplacian form \eqref{eq:plaplacian} with $p=n+1$.  For general beds $b$ less is understood about this operator, but existence holds for \eqref{eq:siavi} \cite{JouvetBueler2012} and a power of the solution lives in a Sobolev space: $(s-b)^{2p/(p-1)} \in W^{1,p}(\Omega)$.  This theory, and also observations of ice sheets, shows that $|\grad s|$ is generally unbounded as one approaches the free boundary from the $s>b$ side.
\end{example}
%\pef{`suggests' is quite weak; can we use a stronger word?}
% Agreed.  Last sentences made brief and direct.

Numerical results are shown in Section \ref{sec:results} for applications of FAScd Algorithms \ref{alg:fascd} and \ref{alg:fascd-fcycle} to these Examples.
%\pef{I'm not sure starting with the example problems we want to solve is the right move. Let me read more and think about it.}
% I think it is o.k.

\section{Constraint decomposition (CD)} \label{sec:cd}

Suppose that there are $m<\infty$ closed subspaces $\cV_i \subset \cV$, so that the sum
\begin{equation}
\cV = \sum_{i=0}^{m-1} \cV_i \label{eq:subspacedecomp}
\end{equation}
holds in the sense that if $w \in \cV$ then there exist $w_i \in \cV_i$ so that $w = \sum_i w_i$.  We say \eqref{eq:subspacedecomp} is a \emph{space decomposition} of $\cV$ \cite{Xu1992}.  For a closed, convex subset $\cK \subset \cV$, suppose further that $\cK_i \subset \cV_i$ are nonempty, closed, and convex subsets such that
\begin{equation}
\cK = \sum_{i=0}^{m-1} \cK_i. \label{eq:constraintdecomp}
\end{equation}
The sum in \eqref{eq:constraintdecomp} must hold in two senses \cite{TaiTseng2002}: \emph{(i)}~if $w \in \cK$ then there exist $w_i \in \cK_i$ so that $w = \sum_i w_i$, and \emph{(ii)}~if $z_i \in \cK_i$ for each $i$ then $\sum_i z_i \in \cK$.  Note that neither decomposition \eqref{eq:subspacedecomp} or \eqref{eq:constraintdecomp} is required to be unique, and also notice that sense \emph{(ii)} is automatic for \eqref{eq:subspacedecomp} because the $\cV_i$ are subspaces.  Finally, suppose there are bounded \emph{decomposition operators}\footnote{Denoted ``$R_i$'' in \cite{Tai2003}.  Here we avoid a notational conflict with multilevel transfer operators (Section \ref{sec:femultilevel}).} $\Pi_i : \cK \to \cK_i$ such that if $v \in \cK$ then
\begin{equation}
v = \sum_{i=0}^{m-1} \Pi_i v.  \label{eq:constraintrestrictionsum}
\end{equation}
The operators $\Pi_i$ are generally nonlinear.  Clearly \eqref{eq:constraintrestrictionsum} implies sense \emph{(i)} for \eqref{eq:constraintdecomp}. Tai \cite{Tai2003} defined a \emph{constraint decomposition} (CD) of $\cK$ to be a choice of $\cV_i,\cK_i,\Pi_i$ satisfying \eqref{eq:subspacedecomp}--\eqref{eq:constraintrestrictionsum}.  Figure \ref{fig:cartoon} suggests how a low-dimensional example might look; note $\cK_i \not\subset \cK$ in this, and in most nontrivial cases as well.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{genfigs/cartoon.pdf}
\caption{A constraint decomposition (CD) for a unilateral obstacle problem on a two-point space $\Omega=\{x_1,x_2\}$, with $\mathcal{V}=\left\{v \,:\, \Omega \to \RR\right\}$ and $\mathcal{K}=\{v\ge \psi\}$.}
\label{fig:cartoon}
\end{figure}

In Sections \ref{sec:femultilevel}--\ref{sec:vcycle} we will introduce multilevel CD discretizations and algorithms for finite-dimensional VI problems.  However, one can observe here that the CD concept applies at the level of the continuum problem, as illustrated in the following two examples, the first of which is an overlapping domain decomposition of a Sobolev space.  Note that $\cK_i \not\subset \cK$ in these cases; informally speaking, the important inclusion is $\cK_i \subset \cV_i$.

\begin{example}  \label{ex:domaindecomposition}  For a bounded domain $\Omega \subset \RR^d$, let $\cV = W_0^{k,p}(\Omega)$ for $k\ge 0$ and $p\ge 1$.  Let $\psi$ be a measurable, real-valued obstacle, defined on $\Omega$, which satisfies $\psi|_{\partial \Omega} \le 0$, and let $\cK = \{v \ge \psi\} \subset \cV$.  Suppose further that $\{\phi_i\}_{i=0}^{m-1}$ is a smooth partition of unity on $\Omega$, satisfying $0 \le \phi_i\le 1$ and $\sum_i \phi_i = 1$, and let $\Omega_i$ be the open support of $\phi_i$.  Let $\cV_i = \{w \in \cV:w|_{\Omega \setminus \Omega_i} =0 \}$, $\cK_i = \{v \in \cV_i: v \ge \phi_i \psi\}$, and $\Pi_i(v) = \phi_i v$.  Then \eqref{eq:subspacedecomp}, \eqref{eq:constraintdecomp}, and \eqref{eq:constraintrestrictionsum} all hold.
\end{example}

Our second example is a disjoint frequency decomposition of a Hilbert space.  A multilevel CD over a finite-dimensional FE discretization, as proposed in Sections \ref{sec:femultilevel} and \ref{sec:cdmultilevel}, approximates such a decomposition.

\begin{example}  \label{ex:frequencydecomposition}  For simplicity suppose $\Omega = (0,a)^d \subset \RR^d$ is a cube, and let $\cV = W_{\text{per}}^{2,k}(\Omega)$ be the periodic functions with square-integrable $k$th derivatives for $k \ge 0$.  Suppose $\psi \in W_{\text{per}}^{2,k}(\Omega)$ and let $\cK = \{v \ge \psi\} \subset \cV$.  Without using any detailed notation for Fourier representation, but noting that the frequencies are discrete because $\Omega$ is compact, suppose $\{\cV_i\}$ are $m<\infty$ subspaces of $\cV$ defined by an (nonoverlapping) partition of $W_{\text{per}}^{2,k}(\Omega)$ by frequency, thus satisfying \eqref{eq:subspacedecomp} as an orthogonal decomposition.  Suppose $P_i:\cV \to \cV_i$ are the corresponding orthogonal projections, satisfying $I = \sum_i P_i$.  Let $\cK_i = \{v \ge P_i \psi\} \subset \cV_i$ and $\Pi_i = P_i$.  Then \eqref{eq:constraintdecomp} and \eqref{eq:constraintrestrictionsum} also hold.
\end{example}

Associated to a constraint decomposition \eqref{eq:subspacedecomp}--\eqref{eq:constraintrestrictionsum} are certain iterative methods \cite{Tai2003,Xu1992}.  Let $0\le \alpha \le 1$ be the \emph{damping parameter}.\footnote{FAScd Algorithms \ref{alg:fascd} and \ref{alg:fascd-fcycle} are presented without damping, and indeed it seems to be unnecessary.  However, the convergence of the more general CD iterations appears to depend upon it.}  Algorithms \ref{alg:basiccd-add} and \ref{alg:basiccd-mult} below, discussed next, solve smaller VI problems over each subset $\cK_i$.  Each Algorithm replaces $u \in \cK$ with a new iterate $w\in\cK$ which should be closer to $u^\star \in \cK$ solving \eqref{eq:vi}.

The additive/parallel \pr{cd-add} Algorithm \ref{alg:basiccd-add} generalizes the classical Jacobi iteration.

Here ``\textbf{for all}'' can be computed in any order.  In its VI,
\begin{equation}
\ip{f(u - \Pi_i u + \hat w_i)}{v_i-\hat w_i} \ge \ip{\ell}{v_i-\hat w_i} \textnormal{ for all } v_i \in \mathcal{K}_i, \label{eq:cdaddvi}
\end{equation}
the expression ``$u-\Pi_iu+\hat w_i$'' removes the part of $u$ which lies in $\mathcal{K}_i$, and then adds-back the subset solution $\hat w_i \in \mathcal{K}_i$.
%\pef{Could remove this explanation, but it's nice to keep it in if we can fit it}
% Proposing to keep for now.

The multiplicative/successive \pr{cd-mult} Algorithm \ref{alg:basiccd-mult} generalizes the Gauss--Seidel iteration.  \begin{pseudofloat}[H]
\begin{pseudo*}

\end{pseudo*}
\caption{One multiplicative CD iteration for VI problem \eqref{eq:vi}.}
\label{alg:basiccd-mult}
\end{pseudofloat}
Each subset solution corrects the global iterate immediately, so here the ordering used in the ``\textbf{for}'' loop is important.  In the VI,
\begin{equation}
\ip{f\Big(\sum_{j<i} w_j + \hat w_i + \sum_{j>i} \Pi_j u\Big)}{v_i-\hat w_i} \ge \ip{\ell}{v_i-\hat w_i} \qquad \forall v_i \in \mathcal{K}_i, \label{eq:cdmultvi}
\end{equation}
the sum ``$\sum_{j>i} \Pi_j u$'' should be read as ``those portions of $u$ which have not yet improved''.



%In VIs \eqref{eq:cdaddvi} and \eqref{eq:cdmultvi} the argument of $f$ is an element of $\cK$.  Furthermore, by \eqref{eq:constraintdecomp} and \eqref{eq:constraintrestrictionsum} one may write the test vector $v_i - \hat w_i \in \cV_i$ as a difference of admissible vectors from $\cK$.  For \eqref{eq:cdaddvi} and \eqref{eq:cdmultvi} respectively:
%\begin{align}
%[u - \Pi_i u + v_i] - [u - \Pi_i u + \hat w_i] &= v_i - \hat w_i, \label{eq:admissibledifferenceadd} \\
%\left[\sum_{j<i} w_j + v_i + \sum_{j>i} \Pi_j u\right] - \left[\sum_{j<i} w_j + \hat w_i + \sum_{j>i} \Pi_j u\right] &= v_i - \hat w_i.  \label{eq:admissibledifferencemult}
%\end{align}
%In this sense the VIs over the subsets $\mathcal{K}_i$ solve the same problem as the original one.

Let $e_i = \hat w_i - \Pi_i u \in \cV_i$.  The reader may confirm that $\hat w = u + \sum_{i} e_i$ and thus that $w = u + \alpha \sum_i e_i$.  The new iterate $w$ is therefore computed by adding a damped correction from each sub\emph{space} $\mathcal{V}_i$, but in such a manner that $w \in \mathcal{K}$; the corrections preserve admissibility.

We call \pr{cd-add} and \pr{cd-mult} the \emph{basic CD iterations}.  VI problems \eqref{eq:cdaddvi} and \eqref{eq:cdmultvi} reduce to constrained line searches when the $\cV_i$ are one-dimensional.  As shown in the next Lemma, when VI problem \eqref{eq:vi} corresponds to convex optimization \eqref{eq:minimization} then, subject to bounds on the damping $\alpha$, these iterations generate monotonically-decreasing objective values.
\begin{lemma} \cite{Tai2003}  Suppose $f=F'$ for $F:\cK\to\RR$ convex and differentiable, and let $u\in\cK$.  For $0 \le \alpha \le 1$ the output $w \in \cK$ from \pr{cd-mult} satisfies
\begin{equation}
F(w) - \ip{\ell}{w} \le F(u) - \ip{\ell}{u}.  \label{eq:objectivemonotone}
\end{equation}
If $0 \le \alpha \le 1/m$ then \pr{cd-add} likewise satisfies \eqref{eq:objectivemonotone}.
\end{lemma}

%\begin{proof}  We assume $\ell=0$ without loss of generality; otherwise define $\tilde F(u)=F(u) - \ip{\ell}{u}$ and observe that the proof goes through for $\tilde F$ essentially unchanged.
%
%To show that each iteration of the {for} loop in \pr{cd-mult} lowers the objective value, let $z_{i} = \sum_{j\le i} w_j + \sum_{j > i} \Pi_j u \in \cK$, $i=0,\dots,m-1$; this is the state at the end of the $i$th iteration.  Note that $z_{i-1} = \sum_{j < i} w_j + \Pi_i u + \sum_{j > i} \Pi_j u$ for $i>0$.  Therefore by convexity of $F$, observation \eqref{eq:admissibledifferencemult} with $v_i=\Pi_i u$, and \eqref{eq:cdmultvi} we find:
%\begin{equation*}
%F(z_{i-1}) - F\left(\sum_{j<i} w_j + \hat w_i + \sum_{j > i} \Pi_j u\right) \ge \ip{f\left(\sum_{j<i} w_j + \hat w_i + \sum_{j > i} \Pi_j u\right)}{\Pi_i u - \hat w_i} \ge 0.
%\end{equation*}
%Using convexity (again) now gives
%\begin{align*}
%F(z_i) &= F\left((1-\alpha) z_{i-1} + \alpha \left(\sum_{j<i} w_j + \hat w_i + \sum_{j > i} \Pi_j u\right)\right) \\
%&\le  (1-\alpha) F(z_{i-1}) + \alpha F\left(\sum_{j<i} w_j + \hat w_i + \sum_{j > i} \Pi_j u\right) \le F(z_{i-1}).
%\end{align*}
%As $u=z_0$ and $w = z_{m-1}$, the result for \pr{cd-mult} follows.
%
%Suppose $w=u+\alpha\sum_i e_i$ is computed by \pr{cd-add} using $\alpha \le 1/m$.  Considering each $e_i=\hat w_i - \Pi_i u$ separately, convexity of $F$ and VI \eqref{eq:cdaddvi} with $v_i=\Pi_i u$ yields
%\begin{equation}
%F(u) - F(u+e_i) \ge \ip{f(u+e_i)}{u-(u+e_i)} = \ip{f(u-\Pi_i u + \hat w_i)}{\Pi_i u - \hat w_i} \ge 0. \label{eq:cdaddonereduction}
%\end{equation}
%Let $v = u+ \frac{1}{m} \sum_i e_i$.  Again using convexity (Jensen's inequality), and \eqref{eq:cdaddonereduction}, we have
%\begin{equation*}
%F(v) = F\left(\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=0}^{m-1} (u+e_i)\right) \le \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=0}^{m-1} F(u+e_i) \le \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=0}^{m-1} F(u) = F(u).
%\end{equation*}
%Now define $\lambda = m\alpha$ so $0 \le \lambda \le 1$ and $w = (1-\lambda) u + \lambda v$.  Thus by convexity and the above result, $F(w) \le (1-\lambda) F(u) + \lambda F(v) \le F(u)$.
%\end{proof}
%When $\alpha=1/m$ then the \pr{cd-add} proof can be simplified because $v=w$ and $\lambda=1$.  In this case $F(w)$ is less than $\frac{1}{m} \sum_i F(u+e_i)$ by Jensen's inequality, which is lower than $F(u)$ by \eqref{eq:cdaddvi} or \eqref{eq:cdmultvi}, which gives inequality \eqref{eq:cdaddonereduction}.

The basic CD iterations are meaningful whether or not we are in the optimization case $f=F'$, and even when $f$ is nonlinear, non-local, or defined only on $\cK$.  However, practical and efficient FE implementation for such general operators $f$ seems not to have been addressed in the literature.  References \cite{GraeserKornhuber2009,Tai2003} only apply the CD method to the classical obstacle problem, wherein $f=F'$ is linear, local, and defined on all of $\mathcal{V}$. Substantial implementation simplifications are available in such cases.

\begin{example}  \label{ex:fnice} Suppose $f:\cV \to \cV'$ is linear and is local in the sense that for any $z\in\mathcal{V}$ the value $\ip{f(\phi)}{z}$ can be computed by an integral over the support of $\phi$.  Considering \pr{cd-add} for concreteness, by linearity \eqref{eq:cdaddvi} can be rewritten
\begin{equation}
\ip{f(e_i)}{v_i-\hat w_i} \ge \ip{\tilde\ell}{v_i-\hat w_i}, \label{eq:linearlocalvi}
\end{equation}
for all $v_i \in \mathcal{K}_i$, where $\tilde\ell = \ell - f(u)$ incorporates the initial residual $f(u)$.  Note $e_i = \hat w_i - \Pi_i u \in \cV_i$ is not generally admissible---generally $e_i \notin \cK$---but \eqref{eq:linearlocalvi} is meaningful for this $f$.
\pef{Can you expand a little bit here? I confess I don't follow.}
\end{example}

When $f$ has the locality of Example \ref{ex:fnice}, an FE approximation of VI \eqref{eq:vi} can be solved in any incremental and efficient manner following the techniques in \cite{GraeserKornhuber2009,Tai2003}, namely by computations over basis function supports.\footnote{Compare equations (2.31) and (2.32) in \cite{Farrelletal2021}, which describe the same sense of locality.}  However, for general problems lacking the niceties of Example \ref{ex:fnice}, certain additional ideas are needed for practical implementation of CD-type iterations.  Section \ref{sec:vcycle} constructs a multiplicative multilevel CD iteration for a general operator $f:\cK\to\cV'$ by applying the full approximation scheme (FAS) idea of Brandt \cite{Brandt1977}.

From now on we restrict to the case of \emph{box constraints} \cite{BensonMunson2006,FerrisPang1997}, equivalently \emph{bi-obstacle problems}.  Suppose $\Omega \subset \RR^d$ is open and let $\mathcal{V}=W^{1,p}(\Omega)$.  The \emph{lower obstacle} $\underline{\gamma}$ and the \emph{upper obstacle} $\overline{\gamma}$ are given functions, defined on the closure $\overline{\Omega}$, with values in the extended real line $\tilde\RR = [-\infty,+\infty]$.  We suppose $\underline{\gamma} : \overline{\Omega} \to [-\infty,+\infty)$ and $\overline{\gamma} : \overline{\Omega} \to (-\infty,+\infty]$ are measurable, $\underline{\gamma} \le \overline{\gamma}$ on $\overline{\Omega}$, and $\underline{\gamma} \le g_D \le \overline{\gamma}$ on $\partial_D \Omega$, and that $\partial\Omega$ is split into disjoint, measurable sets, $\partial\Omega = \partial_D \Omega \cup \partial_N \Omega$, with $\partial_D \Omega$ of positive Hausdorff measure, and $\partial_N \Omega$ possibly empty.  Dirichlet data\footnote{Dirichlet boundary values are in the trace sense \cite{Evans2010}, and $g_D$ is assumed to be as regular as needed.} $g_D:\partial_D \Omega \to \RR$ then defines
\begin{equation}
\cK = \left\{w\,:\,\underline{\gamma} \le w \le \overline{\gamma} \, \text{ and }\, w\big|_{\partial_D \Omega} = g_D\right\} \subset \cV =W^{1,p}(\Omega), \label{eq:originalconstraintset}
\end{equation}
the closed and convex \emph{constraint set}.  Note that we are treating inequality constraints and boundary conditions in a unified manner.\footnote{Any Neumann conditions over $\partial_N \Omega$ are imposed weakly in the definition of $f$, i.e.~by an integration over $\partial_N\Omega$.}

We recall the abstract VI problem \eqref{eq:vi} with constraint sets \eqref{eq:originalconstraintset}.  Given continuous $f:\cK \to \cV'$, and $\ell \in \cV'$, we will assume that the following is well-posed for $u^\star\in \cK$:
\begin{equation}
\ip{f(u^\star)}{v-u^\star} \ge \ip{\ell}{v-u^\star} \qquad \text{for all } v\in \cK. \label{eq:boxdirichletvi}
\end{equation}
Note that $v-u^\star \in W_0^{1,p}(\Omega)$.


\section{Multilevel finite elements} \label{sec:femultilevel}

We seek to rapidly compute the approximate solution of box-constrained VI problems \eqref{eq:boxdirichletvi} using finite elements (FE).  Let $\Omega \subset \RR^d$ be a (open) bounded polygon. We will construct a multilevel FE approximation to \eqref{eq:boxdirichletvi} over $\Omega$ using $P_1$ or $Q_1$ elements \cite{Elmanetal2014}, by refining a coarsest mesh into a nested mesh hierarchy; the goal is an accurate solution on the finest-level mesh.  The hierarchy allows the creation of a multilevel CD of $\cK$, using the ideas in the next two Sections, which permits solvers based on admissibility-preserving coarse corrections.

The mesh hierarchy and FE spaces can be constructed by standard nested refinement.  Let $\mathcal{T}^0$ be the \emph{coarsest mesh}, a finite set of non-overlapping, nondegenerate cells with union equal to $\overline{\Omega}$ and maximum cell diameter (characteristic mesh size) $h_0>0$.  We assume $\mathcal{T}^0$ is conforming, with no hanging nodes.  For $j=1,\dots,J$, let $\mathcal{T}^j$ be the uniform refinement of $\mathcal{T}^{j-1}$ so that each $\mathcal{T}^{j-1}$ cell becomes $2^d$ cells in $\mathcal{T}^j$ with mesh size $h_j = 2^{-j} h_0$.  We call $J\ge 0$ the \emph{depth} of the hierarchy, $J+1$ the \emph{number of levels}, and $\mathcal{T}^J$ the \emph{finest-level mesh}.  Let $m_j$ be the number of vertices in $\mathcal{T}^j$, so there are $m_j$ \emph{degrees of freedom} at the $j$th level.  Let $\mathcal{V}^j$ be the continuous $P_1$ or $Q_1$ FE space over $\mathcal{T}^j$, with arbitrary boundary values, with the standard vector space nesting:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{V}^0 \subset \mathcal{V}^1 \subset \dots \subset \mathcal{V}^J \subset \mathcal{V}=W^{1,p}(\Omega).  \label{eq:fe:nestedspaces}
\end{equation}
On the finest-level mesh let $g_D^J \in \mathcal{V}^J$ satisfy $g_D^J = g_D$ on $\partial_D \Omega$; this restricts $g_D$ in \eqref{eq:originalconstraintset} to be piecewise-linear.

In the material which follows, use of higher-order Lagrange elements, i.e.~$P_k$ or $Q_k$ with $k\ge 2$, would imply a ``variational crime'' \cite[Chapter 10]{BrennerScott2007} special to inequality constraints, which we avoid.  Namely, our FE construction of constraint sets (Section \ref{sec:cdmultilevel}) will require \emph{nodal monotonicity},
\begin{equation}
\bw \ge \bz \quad \implies \quad w \ge z \label{eq:nodalmonotonicity}
\end{equation}
for all $w,z \in \mathcal{V}^j$, where $\bw,\bz \in \RR^{m_j}$ denote vectors of nodal values.  However, for $k\ge 2$ there are basis functions in $P_k$ and $Q_k$, i.e.~functions with nodal values one or zero, which take on negative values \cite[Figure 1.7]{Elmanetal2014}.  Evidently \eqref{eq:nodalmonotonicity} is equivalent to the non-existence of such indefinite-sign basis functions.
\pef{I'm not sure this constitutes a variational crime? We enforce the RHS because it's tractable, and this is only equivalent to what we actually want (the LHS) for P1 and Q1. I don't see where we're departing from the variational framework, however.}

To allow box constraints on all meshes in the hierarchy, let $\tilde{\mathcal{V}}^j$ denote the set of functions on the vertices of $\mathcal{T}^j$ with values in the extended real line $\tilde{\RR} = [-\infty,+\infty]$.  Suppose that the finest-level \emph{lower} and \emph{upper obstacles} $\underline{\gamma}^J, \overline{\gamma}^J \in \tilde{\mathcal{V}}^J$ satisfy
\begin{equation}
\underline{\gamma}^J \le \overline{\gamma}^J, \qquad \underline{\gamma}^J < +\infty, \qquad -\infty < \overline{\gamma}^J. \label{eq:fe:boxconstraintrequirements}
\end{equation}
\pef{Shouldn't there be some relation between the continuous bounds and the discrete ones?}
In analogy to the continuous data, also assume that $\underline{\gamma}^J \le g_D^J \le \overline{\gamma}^J$ on those vertices of $\mathcal{T}^J$ which lie in $\partial_D \Omega$.  Define
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{K}^J = \left\{w\,:\,\underline{\gamma}^J \le w \le \overline{\gamma}^J \text{ on vertices of } \mathcal{T}^J, \, \text{ and } \, w|_{\partial_D\Omega} = g_D^J|_{\partial_D\Omega}\right\} \subset \mathcal{V}^J, \label{eq:fe:fineconstraintset}
\end{equation}
the finest-level \emph{constraint set} of admissible FE functions. This is a nonempty, closed, and convex subset of $\mathcal{V}^J$.  %As $\mathcal{V}^J$ functions never take values $\pm\infty$, inequality in \eqref{eq:fe:fineconstraintset} is strict where $\underline{\gamma}^J, \overline{\gamma}^J$ are infinite; there is no lower or upper constraint, respectively, at such vertices.

Let $f^J:\mathcal{K}^J \to (\mathcal{V}^J)'$ be a discretization of $f$ in \eqref{eq:boxdirichletvi}.  Note that the functional $\ell^J=\ell$ is defined and continuous over $\mathcal{V}^J$.  We seek the FE solution $u^J \in \mathcal{K}^J$ of the finest-level, finite-dimensional, nonlinear VI
\begin{equation}
\ip{f^J(u^J)}{v-u^J} \ge \ip{\ell^J}{v-u^J} \qquad \text{for all } v\in \cK^J. \label{eq:fe:vi}
\end{equation}
If $f^J$ is continuous and $p$-coercive on $\mathcal{K}^J$, in the sense that \eqref{eq:pcoercive} holds for all $u,v \in \mathcal{K}^J$, then the discrete VI \eqref{eq:fe:vi} is well-posed.

While \eqref{eq:fe:vi} approximates \eqref{eq:boxdirichletvi}, we warn the reader that it may not technically be conforming for that VI.  That is, even if quadrature and other implementation details for $f^J$ are ignored, and despite the vector space inclusion $\mathcal{V}^J \subset \mathcal{V}$, we do not require or generally expect $\mathcal{K}^J \subset \mathcal{K}$.  Regardless of the smoothness of the continuum obstacles $\underline{\gamma}, \overline{\gamma}$, admissibility with respect to their FE interpolants $\underline{\gamma}^J, \overline{\gamma}^J$ will generally not imply continuum admissibility.\footnote{This caveat is especially relevant in geophysical situations where only nodal values of the obstacle are known.  Nodal elevation data generally misses the actual topographic detail in-between the vertices; compare \cite{Bueler2016}.}

The multilevel algorithm defined in Section \ref{sec:vcycle}, a solver for \eqref{eq:fe:vi}, requires five transfer operators between meshes.  Of these five operators, three are employed in standard FAS \cite{Trottenbergetal2001}.  We include Table \ref{tab:transfers} to help the reader keep track.

\begin{table}[H]

\end{table}

Canonical prolongation $P:\mathcal{V}^{j-1}\to\mathcal{V}^j$ implements the vector space inclusion $\mathcal{V}^{j-1} \hookrightarrow \mathcal{V}^j$ of coarser-mesh functions.  Canonical (dual) restriction $R:(\mathcal{V}^j)'\to(\mathcal{V}^{j-1})'$ also acts as an identity in the sense that if $\sigma \in (\mathcal{V}^j)'$ then $(R\sigma)[z] = \sigma[z]$ for all $z \in \mathcal{V}^{j-1} \subset \mathcal{V}^j$.  These canonical transfers generally involve a change of FE representation.  For example, $R$ is ``full-weighting'' \cite{Trottenbergetal2001}.

To define injection $\iR:\mathcal{V}^j\to\mathcal{V}^{j-1}$, observe that the vertices of $\mathcal{T}^{j-1}$ are vertices of $\mathcal{T}^j$, and that for any values at $\mathcal{T}^j$ vertices there is a unique $\mathcal{V}^j$ function assuming those values.  For $z\in\mathcal{V}^j$ we define the injection $\iR z$ as the element of $\mathcal{V}^{j-1}$ with the same (coarse) nodal values.  Injection is monotonic: if $w \le z$ then $\iR w \le \iR z$.

\pef{I don't like the name ``monotone restrictions''. The word restriction is strongly associated with operating on the dual space. I would prefer to call them ``monotone injections'', since that is the matching operator.}
The monotone restrictions $\maxR,\minR$ \cite{GraeserKornhuber2009}, which will only be applied to nodal functions $\tilde{\mathcal{V}}^j$, are nonlinear maps which maximize and minimize, respectively, nodal values over the open supports of coarser-mesh basis functions (i.e.~over the \emph{stars} of the coarse vertices). These operators are constructed to enforce the property
\begin{equation}
\minR z \le z \le \maxR z,  \label{eq:fe:monotonerestrictionprops}
\end{equation}
which does not hold for the standard injection operator $\iR$.
To make the construction precise, let $x_q^j$ denote the vertices of mesh $\mathcal{T}^j$, with corresponding basis functions $\psi_q^j(x)$.  For a $\tilde\RR$-valued nodal function $z\in\tilde{\mathcal{V}}^j$ we define functions in $\tilde{\mathcal{V}}^{j-1}$:
\begin{align}
(\maxR z)(x_p^{j-1}) &= \max \{z(x_q^j) \,:\, \psi_p^{j-1}(x_q^j) > 0\}, \label{eq:fe:monotonerestrictions} \\
(\minR z)(x_p^{j-1}) &= \min \{z(x_q^j) \,:\, \psi_p^{j-1}(x_q^j) > 0\}. \notag
\end{align}
For standard refinement a coarse-mesh node $x_p^{j-1}$ is in the set of fine vertices $x_q^j$ such that $\psi_p^{j-1}(x_q^j)>0$, so \eqref{eq:fe:monotonerestrictionprops} follows.
On the other hand, $z\ge 0$ implies $\minR z \ge 0$ and $z \le 0$ implies $\maxR z \le 0$.  These ordering properties are used in the CD construction of the next two Sections.

\section{Multilevel CDs from level defect constraints} \label{sec:cdmultilevel}

A key choice in devising a multilevel scheme for VIs is how to construct coarse-grid bounds.
Our multilevel CD scheme uses \emph{defect constraints} \cite{GraeserKornhuber2009} which are based on an admissible finest-level iterate.  The next Example concretely illustrates why we do not apply restriction operators directly\footnote{An exception is in the F-cycle; see Section \ref{sec:implementation}.} to the finest-level box constraints $\underline{\gamma}^J,\overline{\gamma}^J$.  Our straightforward (iterate-dependent) bounds on the defect constraints, namely \eqref{eq:fe:chiordering} below, bypass the difficulties exposed in Example \ref{ex:directRbad}.

\begin{example}  \label{ex:directRbad}  

Let $\Omega = (0,L) \subset \RR^1$ and consider a two-level mesh hierarchy ($J=1$).  Let $\underline{\gamma}^1$ be a sawtooth function with minimum value zero, and suppose $\overline{\gamma}^1=C+\underline{\gamma}^1$ with $C>0$ which is strictly less than the maximum of $\underline{\gamma}^1$.  Figure \ref{fig:directRbad} shows such functions; here levels $\mathcal{T}^1$ and $\mathcal{T}^0$ have $5$ and $3$ vertices, respectively.  Ignoring Dirichlet boundary for simplicity, the constraint set $\mathcal{K}^1$ defined by \eqref{eq:fe:fineconstraintset} is nonempty.  However, various restriction schemes applied directly to $\underline{\gamma}^1,\overline{\gamma}^1$ are problematic.  Suppose we propose
    $$\underline{\gamma}^0, \overline{\gamma}^0 \equiv \iR \underline{\gamma}^1, \iR \overline{\gamma}^1. \qquad \text{\emph{[problematic]}}$$
Then $\underline{\gamma}^0=0$ and $\overline{\gamma}^0=C$ identically.  In that case the corresponding constraint set $\mathcal{K}^0$ is nonempty, but prolongation $Pw^0$ of an admissible solution of the coarse problem ($\underline{\gamma}^0 \le w^0 \le \overline{\gamma}^0$) is not admissible on the finer level: $Pw^0 \notin \mathcal{K}^1$.  On the other hand, suppose we propose
    $$\underline{\gamma}^0, \overline{\gamma}^0 \equiv \maxR \underline{\gamma}^1, \minR \overline{\gamma}^1. \qquad \text{\emph{[problematic]}}$$
The general motivation for this choice---compare \eqref{eq:fe:chilevels} below---is that $w^0 \ge \underline{\gamma}^0 \, \implies \, Pw^0 \ge \underline{\gamma}^1$ and $w^0 \le \overline{\gamma}^0 \, \implies \, Pw^0 \le \overline{\gamma}^1$.  However, while these facts are true, the difficulty with this choice is that the coarse-level admissible set $\mathcal{K}^0$ is now empty because the proposed lower bound $\underline{\gamma}^0$ actually exceeds the proposed upper bound $\overline{\gamma}^0$.
\end{example}

\begin{figure}[ht]

\caption{For finest-level box constraints $\underline{\gamma}^1,\overline{\gamma}^1$ like these, direct restriction using any of $\iR,\minR,\maxR$, to a coarser mesh (solid dots), is problematic for admissibility of coarse corrections.}
\label{fig:directRbad}
\end{figure}
\pef{Can we put another figure beside it illustrating the choice $\underline{\gamma}^0, \overline{\gamma}^0 \equiv \maxR \underline{\gamma}^1, \minR \overline{\gamma}^1$?}
\pef{Maybe use different colours for upper and lower bounds?}

Subtracting an admissible iterate from the original bounds provides a route out of the difficulties in Example \ref{ex:directRbad}.  Suppose $w^J \in \cK^J$ is an admissible finest-level iterate for \eqref{eq:fe:vi}.  We define the \emph{finest-level defect constraints} (DCs) \cite{GraeserKornhuber2009} as the following nodal functions in $\tilde{\mathcal{V}}^J$:
\begin{equation}
\underline{\chi}^J = \underline{\gamma}^J - w^J, \qquad \overline{\chi}^J = \overline{\gamma}^J - w^J. \label{eq:fe:defectconstraints}
\end{equation}
Definition \eqref{eq:fe:fineconstraintset} implies that $\underline{\chi}^J \le 0 \le \overline{\chi}^J$ everywhere in $\overline{\Omega}$, including on the Dirichlet boundary $\partial_D\Omega$.  If $\underline{\gamma}^J=-\infty$ then $\underline{\chi}^J=-\infty$ by definition, and similarly if $\overline{\gamma}^J=+\infty$ then $\overline{\chi}^J=+\infty$.  Observe that a corrected iterate $w^J + z^J$ is admissible, $w^J + z^J \in \cK^J$, if and only if the perturbation $z^J \in \mathcal{V}^J$ is zero on $\partial_D\Omega$ and bounded by the defect constraints, $\underline{\chi}^J \le z^J \le \overline{\chi}^J$.

Descending coarser levels, $j=J-1,\dots,1,0$, we apply the monotone restrictions to generate \emph{level defect constraints} (LDCs) in $\tilde{\mathcal{V}}^j$:
\begin{equation}
\underline{\chi}^{j} = \maxR \underline{\chi}^{j+1}, \qquad \overline{\chi}^{j} = \minR \overline{\chi}^{j+1}. \label{eq:fe:chilevels}
\end{equation}
Observe that
\begin{equation}
\underline{\chi}^{J} \le \dots \le \underline{\chi}^0 \le 0 \le \overline{\chi}^0 \le \dots \le \overline{\chi}^J. \label{eq:fe:chiordering}
\end{equation}
A unilateral $J=4$ example of LDCs $\underline{\chi}^j$ is shown in Figure \ref{fig:chiphilevels}.  The LDC $\underline{\chi}^j$ is the most-negative function from $\tilde{\mathcal{V}}^j$ such that if another element of $\tilde{\mathcal{V}}^j$ is above $\underline{\chi}^j$ then it is also above $\underline{\chi}^{j+1}$; similar comments apply to $\overline{\chi}^{j}$.

\end{figure}

This construction of multilevel box constraints, fundamentally the same as the unilateral construction in \cite{GraeserKornhuber2009}, is designed to permit large-yet-admissible coarse corrections, which promotes multilevel solver efficiency.  Note that for Algorithm \ref{alg:fascd} below, any system satisfying \eqref{eq:fe:chiordering} will suffice; the particular formulas in \eqref{eq:fe:chilevels} are not required.

We now compute the LDC differences \cite{GraeserKornhuber2009}:
\pef{Say a few words of motivation first for introducing this concept.}
\begin{equation}
\underline{\phi}^j = \underline{\chi}^j - \underline{\chi}^{j-1}, \qquad \overline{\phi}^j = \overline{\chi}^j - \overline{\chi}^{j-1}.  \label{eq:fe:philevels}
\end{equation}
We take $\underline{\chi}^{-1}=\overline{\chi}^{-1}=0$ so that $\underline{\phi}^0=\underline{\chi}^0$ and $\overline{\phi}^0=\overline{\chi}^0$.  Regarding subtraction of extended real-valued quantities, if $\underline{\chi}^j(x_p)=-\infty$ then we set $\underline{\phi}^j(x_p)=-\infty$ regardless of the value of $\underline{\chi}^{j-1}(x_p)$, and similarly $\overline{\phi}^j(x_p)=+\infty$ if $\overline{\chi}^j(x_p)=+\infty$.  While $\underline{\phi}^{j},\overline{\phi}^{j} \in \tilde{\mathcal{V}}^J$ again bracket zero, $\underline{\phi}^j \le 0 \le \overline{\phi}^j$, they are not ordered as in \eqref{eq:fe:chiordering}.

The corresponding \emph{downward/upward constraint sets}, respectively, are closed and convex subsets of the FE spaces $\mathcal{V}^j$:
\begin{align}
\mathcal{D}^j = \left\{v \in \mathcal{V}^j \,:\, \underline{\phi}^j \le v \le \overline{\phi}^j \text{ and } \, v|_{\partial_D\Omega} = 0\right\}, \label{eq:fe:constraintsets} \\
\mathcal{U}^j = \left\{v \in \mathcal{V}^j \,:\, \underline{\chi}^j \le v \le \overline{\chi}^j \text{ and } \, v|_{\partial_D\Omega} = 0\right\}. \notag
\end{align}
Because $\underline{\chi}^j \le \underline{\phi}^j \le 0 \le \overline{\phi}^j \le \overline{\chi}^j$, it follows that $\mathcal{D}^j \subseteq \mathcal{U}^j$.  Note that the finest-level set $\mathcal{U}^J$ is equivalent to the original constraint set $\mathcal{K}^J$: for all $z^J \in \mathcal{V}^J$,
\begin{equation}
z^J \in \mathcal{U}^J \quad \iff \quad w^J+z^J \in \mathcal{K}^J. \label{eq:fe:finestlevelequivalent}
\end{equation}

Our V-cycle solver (Algorithm \ref{alg:fascd}) will compute corrections in $\mathcal{D}^j$ for the downward stage and in $\mathcal{U}^j$ for the upward stage. This strategy is, however, based on \emph{incomplete} CDs, in the general box-constrained cases, as we now explain.  Each upward set $\mathcal{U}^j$ is generally only a superset of a sum of downward sets $\mathcal{D}^j$, but this becomes a true CD, i.e.~satisfying \eqref{eq:subspacedecomp}--\eqref{eq:constraintrestrictionsum}, in unilateral cases.  The following Lemma, apparently new, is based in part on the unilateral CD construction underlying Algorithm 4.7 in \cite{GraeserKornhuber2009}; see also equation (59) in \cite{Tai2003}.

\begin{lemma}  \label{lem:downwardadmissibility}  For arbitrary finest-level box constraints $\underline{\gamma}^J,\overline{\gamma}^J$ satisfying \eqref{eq:fe:boxconstraintrequirements}, it follows that
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{U}^j \supseteq \mathcal{D}^j + \mathcal{D}^{j-1} + \dots + \mathcal{D}^0 \label{eq:fe:downwardsuminclusion}
\end{equation}
for $j=0,1,\dots,J$.  In unilateral cases, where either $\underline{\gamma}^J=-\infty$ identically or $\overline{\gamma}^J=+\infty$ identically, inclusion \eqref{eq:fe:downwardsuminclusion} becomes a full CD with $\mathcal{U}^j=\sum_{i=0}^j \mathcal{D}^i$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}  Subspace decomposition \eqref{eq:subspacedecomp} holds---see nesting \eqref{eq:fe:nestedspaces}---and definition \eqref{eq:fe:constraintsets} shows $\mathcal{D}^i \subset \mathcal{U}^i \subset \cV^i$.  Furthermore, telescoping sums hold for any $j=0,1,\dots,J$:
\begin{equation}
\sum_{i=0}^j \underline{\phi}^i = \underline{\chi}^j, \qquad \sum_{i=0}^j \overline{\phi}^i = \overline{\chi}^j.  \label{eq:fe:telescoping}
\end{equation}
Thus if $y^i \in \mathcal{D}^i$ for $0 \le i \le j$ then
\begin{equation}
\underline{\chi}^j = \sum_{i=0}^j \underline{\phi}^i \le \sum_{i=0}^j y^i \le \sum_{i=0}^j \overline{\phi}^i \le \overline{\chi}^j, \label{eq:fe:lemmaordering}
\end{equation}
so \eqref{eq:fe:downwardsuminclusion} holds for any box constraints.

In unilateral cases we can also construct decomposition operators $\Pi_i$ and thereby show property \eqref{eq:constraintrestrictionsum}.  For concreteness suppose $\overline{\gamma}^J=+\infty$, thus $\overline{\chi}^j=+\infty$ and $\overline{\phi}^i = +\infty$ for all levels.  For $v\in \mathcal{V}^j$ and $0\le i \le j$, let $I_{j\to i}^\ominus$ be the operator applying the minimum (monotone) restriction $j-i$ times, mapping into $\mathcal{V}^i$:
\begin{equation}
I_{j\to i}^\ominus v = \minR(\dots(\minR v)\dots)  \label{eq:fe:minimummaps}
\end{equation}
(Set $I_{j\to j}^\ominus v = v$ and $I_{j\to -1}^\ominus=0$ by definition.)  Now define the following nonlinear decomposition operators $\Pi_i:\mathcal{U}^j \to \mathcal{D}^i$:
\begin{equation}
\Pi_i z^j = I_{j\to i}^\ominus(z^j - \underline{\chi}^j) - I_{j\to i-1}^\ominus(z^j - \underline{\chi}^j) + \underline{\phi}^i.  \label{eq:fe:unilateraldecompositionoperator}
\end{equation}
(Compare equation (4.9) in \cite{GraeserKornhuber2009}.)  Property \eqref{eq:fe:monotonerestrictionprops} implies $I_{j\to i}^\ominus(z^j - \underline{\chi}^j) \ge I_{j\to i-1}^\ominus(z^j - \underline{\chi}^j)$, thus $\Pi_i z^j \ge \underline{\phi}^i$, so $\Pi_i z^j \in \mathcal{D}^i$.  On the other hand, the following sum telescopes, leaving only its first term plus the sum in \eqref{eq:fe:telescoping}:
\begin{align*}
\sum_{i=0}^j \Pi_i z^j &= z^j - \underline{\chi}^j + \sum_{i=0}^j \underline{\phi}^i = z^j.
\end{align*}
This shows \eqref{eq:constraintrestrictionsum}, thus that \eqref{eq:fe:downwardsuminclusion} is equality, yielding \eqref{eq:constraintdecomp}.  The $\underline{\gamma}^J=-\infty$ case is similar.
\end{proof}

One might try to turn \eqref{eq:fe:downwardsuminclusion} into a full CD for arbitrary box constraints by using decomposition maps like $\Pi_i$, for example by splitting $z^j = \min\{z^j,0\} + \max\{z^j,0\}$ and applying unilateral formulas like \eqref{eq:fe:unilateraldecompositionoperator} to $\min\{z^j,0\}$ and $\max\{z^j,0\}$ separately.  The above proof shows that the lower bound $\Pi_i (\min\{z^j,0\}) \ge \underline{\phi}^i$ does hold.  However, the following Example\footnote{Of course, this Example does not exclude the existence of an entirely-different strategy for showing a full CD in the general box-constrained case.} shows why $\Pi_i(\min\{z^j,0\})$ may have an arbitrarily large maximum, and thus exceed any finite upper LDC $\overline{\phi}^i$.  In fact, $\Pi_i$ does not generally map all non-positive elements of $\mathcal{U}^J$ into $\mathcal{D}^i$ if a finite upper LDC is present.

\begin{example}  \label{ex:notfullcd}
Let $a > 0$ be an arbitrary positive number.  Consider a 2-level hierarchy ($J=1$), and suppose the lower defect constraint is the constant function $\underline{\chi}^1=-a$.  Note $\underline{\chi}^0=\maxR \underline{\chi}^1=-a$ also, so $\underline{\phi}^1=0$ and $\underline{\phi}^0=-a$.  Suppose $z^1$ is a ``sawtooth'' function which takes on value $-a$ on the coarse vertices and value $0$ on the other vertices.  Then, for any $\overline{\chi}^1\ge 0$, we have $\overline{\chi}^1 \ge 0 \ge z^1\ge \underline{\chi}^1$, so $z^j \in \mathcal{U}^1$.  However, $I_{1\to 0}^\ominus(z^1 - \underline{\chi}^1) = \minR(z^1 - \underline{\chi}^1) = 0$ identically.  From \eqref{eq:fe:unilateraldecompositionoperator}, $\Pi_1 z^1$ simplifies to $\Pi_1 z^1 = z^1 - \underline{\chi}^1$.  But then $\Pi_1 z^1$ attains a maximum $a\ge 0$.  This maximum can be chosen to exceed any upper defect obstacle $\overline{\phi}^1$, so $\Pi_1 z^1 \notin \mathcal{D}^1$.
\end{example}

Each upward set $\mathcal{U}^j$ can also be decomposed (incompletely) down to an arbitrary coarser level.  The next Lemma, which does not follow from Lemma \ref{lem:downwardadmissibility}, justifies upward admissibility in Algorithm \ref{alg:fascd}.

\begin{lemma}  \label{lem:upwardadmissibility}  For any $j=0,1,\dots,J$ and $0\le k\le j$,
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{U}^j \supseteq \mathcal{D}^j + \mathcal{D}^{j-1} + \dots + \mathcal{D}^{k+1} + \mathcal{U}^k \label{eq:fe:upwardsuminclusion}
\end{equation}
In unilateral cases, where either $\underline{\gamma}^J=-\infty$ or $\overline{\gamma}^J=+\infty$, actually $\mathcal{U}^j = \mathcal{U}^k + \sum_{i=k+1}^j \mathcal{D}^i$. \end{lemma}

\begin{proof}  Definition \eqref{eq:fe:philevels} shows that $\underline{\chi}^j = \underline{\phi}^j + \dots + \underline{\phi}^{k+1} + \underline{\chi}^k$ and $\overline{\chi}^j = \overline{\phi}^j + \dots + \overline{\phi}^{k+1} + \overline{\chi}^k$.  If $y^i \in \mathcal{D}^i$ for $k+1 \le i \le j$ and $z^k \in \mathcal{U}^k$ then $\underline{\chi}^j \le y^j + \dots + y^{k+1} + z^k \le \overline{\chi}^j$ and \eqref{eq:fe:upwardsuminclusion}.

In unilateral cases we follow the proof of Lemma \ref{lem:downwardadmissibility}.  We can use \eqref{eq:fe:unilateraldecompositionoperator} unchanged for $i=k+1,\dots,j$, but it must be modified in the $i=k$ case: $\Pi_k z^j = I_{j\to k}^\ominus(z^j - \underline{\chi}^j) + \underline{\chi}^k$.  The remainder of the proof goes through as before.
\end{proof}

Inclusions \eqref{eq:fe:downwardsuminclusion} and \eqref{eq:fe:upwardsuminclusion}, which are special to multilevel schemes based on defect constraints, hold regardless of whether a CD operator $\Pi_i$ can be constructed.  Here there is, in fact, another ``basic'' iteration, an incomplete variant of \pr{cd-mult} (Algorithm \ref{alg:basiccd-mult}) that does not need the $\Pi_i$ operators.  It is a variant of \pr{cd-mult} (Algorithm \ref{alg:basiccd-mult}).

\label{alg:basiccd-tele}
\end{pseudofloat}

While inclusions \eqref{eq:fe:downwardsuminclusion} and \eqref{eq:fe:upwardsuminclusion} suffice to show the admissibility of all iterates and corrections in Algorithm \ref{alg:fascd} below, a convergence analysis, perhaps extending the arguments of \cite{Tai2003} or \cite{GraeserKornhuber2009} to VIs which are not of minimization type, and/or to box constraints, would seem to require full CDs.  We cannot currently offer that analysis.


\section{FAScd V-cycle} \label{sec:vcycle}

The V-cycle algorithm in this section applies smoothers in constraint sets $\mathcal{D}^j$ and $\mathcal{U}^j$ during the downward and upward stages, respectively.  It extends the multilevel CD schemes of Tai \cite{Tai2003} and Gr\"aser \& Kornhuber \cite[Algorithm 4.7]{GraeserKornhuber2009} by following a nonlinear full approximation scheme (FAS) approach \cite{BrandtLivne2011}.  In fact, it reduces to FAS for PDEs when inequality constraints are removed (Appendix \ref{app:reductions}).

Each V-cycle generates a correction to a finest-level iterate $w^J \in \mathcal{K}^J$ by incorporating information from each coarser FE subspace $\mathcal{V}^j$.  By nesting \eqref{eq:fe:nestedspaces} these corrections all live in the fine-level subspace $\mathcal{V}^J$,\footnote{Nonetheless we use prolongation $P$ to indicate where the computer representation changes.} and are constructed so that the corrected iterate remains admissible.  Proceeding inductively, suppose $y^i \in \mathcal{D}^i$ for $i=J,\dots,j+1$ \pef{I changed the sign here from $j-1$ to $j+1$, double-check} are already-computed corrections during the downward part of the V-cycle (Figure \ref{fig:fascdvcycle}).  By \eqref{eq:fe:downwardsuminclusion} the correction at this point is admissible, namely $y^J + \dots + y^{j+1} \in \mathcal{U}^J$, equivalently $w^J + y^J + \dots + y^{j+1} \in \mathcal{K}^J$.  Smoothing then occurs at the next-coarser level, yielding the next correction $y^j \in \mathcal{D}^j$.  At the bottom the coarsest-level VI is then solved, resulting in the full downward correction $y^J + \dots + y^1 + z^0 \in \mathcal{U}^J$.  Starting upward, $y^1 + z^0 \in \mathcal{U}^1$ is an initial iterate for smoothing on level $j=1$, which then yields $z^1 \in \mathcal{U}^1$ and an admissible correction $y^J + \dots + y^2 + z^1 \in \mathcal{U}^J$, using \eqref{eq:fe:upwardsuminclusion}.  Continuing in this ``telescoping'' way (Algorithm \ref{alg:basiccd-tele}), up-smoothing in the constraint sets $\mathcal{U}^j$, starting from initial iterate $y^j+z^{j-1}$, finally generates $z^J\in \mathcal{U}^J$ as the V-cycle correction.  Then the next admissible iterate is $\tilde{w}^J = w^J + z^J \in \mathcal{K}^J$.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}
\input{tikz/vcycle.tex}
\end{center}
\caption{The FAScd V-cycle computes downward corrections $y_j \in \mathcal{D}^j$, but the upward corrections $z_j\in\mathcal{U}^j$ are in larger sets.}
\label{fig:fascdvcycle}
\end{figure}

A key idea is that, because of inclusions \eqref{eq:fe:upwardsuminclusion}, up-smoothing solves less-restricted VI problems than down-smoothing.  Intuitively-speaking, going downward one does not know what the next coarse corrections will be, and thus on any level one must choose conservative constraint sets $\mathcal{D}^j$ so that the sum of the corrections is admissible once we return to a given level.  Going upward, however, no further coarse corrections can violate admissibility.

To state the V-cycle algorithm below we must also clarify the problems solved at each mesh level.  As in FAS multigrid for nonlinear PDEs \cite{BrandtLivne2011,Bruneetal2015,Trottenbergetal2001}, both the solution approximation and the residual must be coarsened, and a source functional created.  On mesh level $j$ we assume a re-discretized nonlinear operator $f^j$, with output in $(\cV^j)'$, which is an FE discretization of $f$ in \eqref{eq:boxdirichletvi}.\footnote{Presumably it uses quadrature etc.~in the same scheme which generated $f^J$ in \eqref{eq:fe:vi}.}  Finally, we assume that an admissible iterate $w^J \in \mathcal{K}^J$ has already\footnote{In practice the LDCs $\underline{\chi}^j,\overline{\chi}^j,\underline{\phi}^j,\overline{\phi}^j$ are generated during the descent stage; see Algorithm \ref{alg:fascd}.} been used to generate the LDCs and constraint sets $\mathcal{D}^j$, $\mathcal{U}^j$ at each level (Section \ref{sec:cdmultilevel}); these LDCs do not depend on the coarse-level corrections.

As we descend we define new $j$th-level iterates
\begin{equation}
w^j = \iR(w^{j+1} + y^{j+1}).  \label{eq:fe:definew}
\end{equation}
(These are the states before smoothing or correction.)  From $w^j$ we define $\ell^j \in (\cV^j)'$:
\begin{equation}
\ell^j = \begin{cases} \ell^J, & j=J \\
                       f^j(w^j) + R\left(\ell^{j+1}-f^{j+1}(w^{j+1}+y^{j+1})\right), & j<J. \end{cases} \label{eq:fe:levelsource}
\end{equation}
Observe that injection $\iR$ coarsens the (primal) iterates---injection is commonly used in classical FAS \cite[section 5.3]{Trottenbergetal2001}---but canonical restriction $R$ coarsens (dual) linear functionals; recall Table \ref{tab:transfers}.

On descent, at levels $j=J,J-1,\dots,1$, we solve the following VI for $y^j \in \mathcal{D}^j$:
\begin{equation}
\ip{f^j(w^j + y^j)}{v-y^j} \ge \ip{\ell^j}{v-y^j} \qquad \text{for all } v\in \mathcal{D}^j, \label{eq:fe:downvi}
\end{equation}
for which the initial iterate is $y_{(0)}^j=0$.  (Zero is admissible; see the comment after \eqref{eq:fe:philevels}.)  On ascent, $j=0,1,\dots,J$, the same VI is solved but for $z^j \in \mathcal{U}^j$:
\begin{equation}
\ip{f^j(w^j + z^j)}{v-z^j} \ge \ip{\ell^j}{v-z^j} \qquad \text{for all } v\in \mathcal{U}^j. \label{eq:fe:upvi}
\end{equation}
The nontrivial initial iterate for this problem is found by prolonging $z^{j-1}$ and using it to correct the current (i.e.~down-smoothed) correction on the level:
\begin{equation}
z_{(0)}^j = y^j + P z^{j-1}.  \label{eq:fe:upwardinitial}
\end{equation}
An exception is that $z_{(0)}^0=0$ on the coarsest level.  Note $z_{(0)}^j$ is admissible by \eqref{eq:fe:upwardsuminclusion}.

%If we were to inject the original box constraints \eqref{eq:fe:fineconstraintset} downward to coarser meshes, i.e.~$\underline{\gamma}^j = \iR \underline{\gamma}^{j+1}$ and $\overline{\gamma}^j = \iR \overline{\gamma}^{j+1}$, then, because injection preserves inequalities, and because $y^{j+1} \in \mathcal{D}^{j+1}$, it would follow from \eqref{eq:fe:definew} that $\underline{\gamma}^j \le w^j \le \overline{\gamma}^j$.  In this sense $w^j$ is admissible with respect to the box constraints.  However, while $w^j \in \cV^j \subset \cV^J$ holds, generally $w^j \notin \cK^J$, and furthermore our use of LDCs (Section \ref{sec:cdmultilevel}) avoids the need to generate these $\underline{\gamma}^j, \overline{\gamma}^j$.

Observe that formula \eqref{eq:fe:levelsource} for functional $\ell^j$ is a classical FAS construction for PDEs; compare equation (8.5b) in \cite{BrandtLivne2011} or equation (5.3.14) in \cite{Trottenbergetal2001}.  It has the following explanation, which simultaneously justifies VI problems \eqref{eq:fe:downvi} and \eqref{eq:fe:upvi}.  First, the $j+1$ level problem \eqref{eq:fe:downvi} is not solved exactly by the finer-level correction $y^{j+1}$---the down-smoother was only approximate---so we seek a further correction $y$ on the $j+1$ level such that
\begin{equation}
\ip{f^{j+1}(w^{j+1}+y^{j+1}+y)}{v-y^{j+1}-y} \ge \ip{\ell^{j+1}}{v-y^{j+1}-y} \quad \text{\emph{(notional)}} \label{eq:fe:downvinotional}
\end{equation}
for all $v\in \mathcal{D}^j$.  However, in fact $y$ will be approximated by solving a coarser, $j$th-level problem generated by modifying \eqref{eq:fe:downvinotional} in 4 steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item subtract the computable quantity $f^{j+1}(w^{j+1}+y^{j+1}) \in (\mathcal{V}^{j+1})'$ from both sides,
\item replace the residual $\ell^{j+1}-f^{j+1}(w^{j+1}+y^{j+1})$ on the right by its restriction,
\item replace $w^{j+1}+y^{j+1}$, where it appears on the left, by its restriction, and
\item where it appears on the left, replace $f^{j+1}$ by the coarser rediscretization $f^j$.
\end{enumerate}
Steps \emph{(ii)}--\emph{(iv)} are justified when the residual and the error are smooth; such smoothness should result from application of the down-smoother.  These steps yield a problem for the $j$th-level correction $y^j \in \mathcal{D}^j$:
\begin{align}
&\ip{f^j\left(\iR(w^{j+1}+y^{j+1})+y^j\right)}{v-y^j} - \ip{f^j\left(\iR(w^{j+1}+y^{j+1})\right)}{v-y^j} \label{eq:fe:downvicluttered} \\
&\qquad \ge \ip{R\left(\ell^{j+1}-f^{j+1}(w^{j+1}+y^{j+1})\right)}{v-y^j} \notag
\end{align}
This is the same as VI problem \eqref{eq:fe:downvi}, but in cluttered form, motivating definitions \eqref{eq:fe:definew} and \eqref{eq:fe:levelsource}.  The explanation for VI \eqref{eq:fe:upvi} is similar.

These ideas come together in Algorithm \ref{alg:fascd}, \pr{fascd-vcycle}, which updates $w^J$.  It assumes that the \pr{smooth} and \pr{solve} procedures do in-place modifications of their final arguments, without modifying their first four arguments.  Parameters \id{down} and \id{up} determine the number of smoother iterations, respectively.

\label{alg:fascd}
\end{pseudofloat}

Algorithm \ref{alg:fascd} is a $V(1,1)$ cycle.\footnote{We could write ``$V(\id{down},\id{up})$'', but we prefer to emphasize the number of subsets used on each level rather than the number of smoother sweeps in a given set. \pef{I don't understand what the number of subsets used on each level means.}}  If \id{up} $=0$ then it becomes a $V(1,0)$ cycle and if \id{down} $=0$ then it is a $V(0,1)$ cycle; in the former case it generalizes Algorithm 4.7 in \cite{GraeserKornhuber2009} by allowing nonlinear operators $f$, any smoother, and applying FAS-type corrections.  In unilateral cases, one iteration of \pr{fascd-vcycle} is an application of \pr{cd-mult} over CD \eqref{eq:fe:downwardsuminclusion} followed by an application of \pr{icd-tele} (Section \ref{sec:cdmultilevel}) over incomplete CD \eqref{eq:fe:upwardsuminclusion}; in this sense $V(1,1)=V(1,0)+V(0,1)$.

Regarding the storage required, let us assuming all box constraints are nontrivial. In this case, seven vectors must be allocated on each level: $\underline{\chi}^j$, $\overline{\chi}^j$, $\underline{\phi}^j$, $\overline{\phi}^j$, $w^j$, $\ell^j$, $y^j$.  Note $z^j$ can use the same storage as $y^j$.  On the finest level one must also store $\underline{\gamma}^J$ and $\overline{\gamma}^J$, while on the coarsest level there are only five vectors because $\underline{\phi}^0=\underline{\chi}^0$ and $\overline{\phi}^0=\overline{\chi}^0$.  Therefore, using $m_j=2^d m_{j-1}$, plus a geometric series argument, the total storage, excluding smoother and coarse-solver implementations, is
\begin{equation}
9 m_J + 7 m_{J-1} + \dots + 7 m_1 + 5 m_0 \le \left(9 + \frac{7}{2^d - 1}\right) m_J.
\end{equation}
This gives storage at most $16m_J$, $12m_J$, and $10m_J$ in dimensions $d=1,2,3$, respectively.  For comparison, a single-level method needs $4 m_J$ storage (i.e.~$\underline{\gamma}^J,\overline{\gamma}^J,\ell^J,w^J$).  If some of the obstacles are trivial, for instance in the unilateral case $\overline{\gamma}^J=+\infty$, storage can be correspondingly reduced at all levels.


\section{Implementation} \label{sec:implementation}

In this section we consider the implementation of FAScd methods.  We address convergence criteria, the F-cycle extension, and an active set Newton method used as a smoother and coarse solver.

Because the problem is inequality-constrained, repeated application of Algorithm \ref{alg:fascd} to solve the finite-dimensional, box-constrained VI \eqref{eq:fe:vi} will not generally reduce the residual $f^J(w^J) - \ell^J$ to zero everywhere.  To construct appropriate convergence criteria for the discretization, note \eqref{eq:fe:vi} is equivalent to a \emph{mixed complementarity problem} (MCP) \cite{FacchineiPang2003}.  Let $x_p \in \mathcal{T}^J$ be a finest-level node, and $\psi_p(x)$ the corresponding basis function.  Let $\mathcal{X}^J=\big\{w\in\cV^J\,:\,w(x_p)=g_D^J(x_p) \text{ if } x_p\in \partial_D\Omega\big\}$, thus $\cK^J = \left\{\underline{\gamma}^J \le w \le \overline{\gamma}^J\right\} \cap \mathcal{X}^J$.  If $m_D$ is the number of vertices $x_p$ in the Dirichlet boundary, let $I_D$ be the $m_D\times m_J$ matrix which extracts Dirichlet nodal values; its transpose $I_D^\top$ injects Dirichlet boundary degrees of freedom into $(\mathcal{V}^J)'$.  Finally, write $a\perp b$ when $a,b \in \RR^n$ are \emph{complementary}, that is, when $a_i \ge 0$ and $b_i \ge 0$ and $a_i b_i = 0$ for $i=0,\dots,n-1$.  Then problem \eqref{eq:fe:vi}, which would be expressed VI$\left(f^J(\cdot)-\ell^J,\left[\,\underline{\gamma}^J,\overline{\gamma}^J\right] \cap \mathcal{X}^J\right)$ in the operations research literature \cite{FerrisPang1997}, is equivalent to the following MCP for the solution $u^J \in \mathcal{K}^J$, but with additional equality constraints:
\begin{align}
\underline{\gamma}^J \le u^J \le \overline{\gamma}^J \quad &\perp \quad f^J(u^J) - \ell^J - I_D^\top \lambda \label{eq:fe:mcp} \\
I_D u^J &= g_D^J\big|_{\partial_D\Omega} \notag
\end{align}
for some Lagrange multipliers $\lambda \in \RR^{m_D}$.
\pef{I wonder if this definition will confuse people, because they won't know how to plug in $\underline{\gamma}^J \le u^J \le \overline{\gamma}^J$ into your definition of $\perp$ ($\underline{\gamma}^J \le u^J \le \overline{\gamma}^J$ is not in $\RR^n$). Maybe it would be easier to just use the spelled-out version below, and not use this notation?}

By definition, MCP \eqref{eq:fe:mcp} says that certain node-wise conditions hold for $u^J$ at $x_p \in \mathcal{T}^J$.  Let $r(u^J)_p = \ip{f^J(w^J)-\ell^J}{\psi_p}$ be the pointwise (ordinary) residual.  If $x_p \notin \partial_D\Omega$ then one of these four conditions hold:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\underline{\gamma}^J(x_p)<u^J(x_p)<\overline{\gamma}^J(x_p)$ and $r(u^J)_p = 0$,
\item $\underline{\gamma}^J(x_p)=u^J(x_p)<\overline{\gamma}^J(x_p)$ and $r(u^J)_p \ge 0$,
\item $\underline{\gamma}^J(x_p)<u^J(x_p)=\overline{\gamma}^J(x_p)$ and $r(u^J)_p \le 0$,
\item $\underline{\gamma}^J(x_p)=u^J(x_p)=\overline{\gamma}^J(x_p)$.
\end{itemize}
Otherwise, if $x_p \in \partial_D\Omega$ then
\begin{itemize}
\item $u^J(x_p)=g_D^J(x_p)$ and $\lambda_p=r(u^J)_p$.
\end{itemize}
The cases might be labeled \emph{inactive}, \emph{lower active}, \emph{upper active}, \emph{pinched} (\emph{both active}), and \emph{boundary}, respectively.  Where \emph{pinched} applies, $r(u^J)_p$ can have any real value.

Thus \eqref{eq:fe:mcp} allows us to construct expressions whose norms should go below tolerance.  First, interpreting the MCP directly, for $w^J \in \mathcal{K}^J$ we define the finest-level \emph{nodal complementarity residual} $\rNC(w^J)$ from the five cases:
\begin{equation}
\rNC(w^J)_p = \begin{cases}
    r(w^J)_p, & \underline{\gamma}^J(x_p) < w^J(x_p) < \overline{\gamma}^J(x_p), \\
    \min\{r(w^J)_p,0\}, & w^J(x_p) = \underline{\gamma}^J(x_p), \\
    \max\{r(w^J)_p,0\}, & w^J(x_p) = \overline{\gamma}^J(x_p), \\
    0, & \underline{\gamma}^J(x_p)=w^J(x_p)=\overline{\gamma}^J(x_p), \\
    w^J(x_p) - g_D^J(x_p), & x_p \in \partial_D\Omega. \end{cases} \label{eq:rNC}
\end{equation}
The first four cases assume $x_p \notin \partial_D\Omega$.  For PDEs one uses only the first and last cases.

In summary, $\rNC : \mathcal{K}^J \to \RR^{m_J}$ is a computable nonlinear map defined using the discretization $f^J$ and the vectors $\ell^J$, $\underline{\gamma}^J$, and $\overline{\gamma}^J$.  A value $\rNC(w^J)_p$ is nonzero only at vertices where \eqref{eq:fe:mcp} is violated, either because $r(w^J)_p$ remains nonzero where the constraints are inactive, or because it has the wrong sign at an active node, or because the boundary condition is not satisfied.

\pef{I think this is all fairly standard and we could abbreviate this section substantially.}

Direct implementation of \eqref{eq:rNC} is, however, sensitive to rounding error because $\rNC$ is a discontinuous function of $w^J(x_p)$.  For example, if $w^J(x_p)$ exceeds $\underline{\gamma}^J(x_p)$ by $10^{-16}$, then, instead of returning the minimum of $r(w^J)_p$ and zero (the second case), the first case applies, so $\rNC(w^J)_p$ might be large and positive.  This situation would falsely suggest that the iteration is far from converging.  On the other hand, formula \eqref{eq:rNC} applies as stated if $\underline{\gamma}^J(x_p)=-\infty$ or $\overline{\gamma}^J(x_p)=+\infty$.  Compare \eqref{eq:rSS} in this case, wherein the difference $w^J(x_p) - \underline{\gamma}^J(x_p)$ is computed.

We will instead measure convergence using a \emph{semi-smooth residual} based on the Fischer-Burmeister function \cite{BensonMunson2006,Ulbrich2011} on $a,b\in\RR$:
\begin{equation}
\phi(a,b) = a + b - \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}. \label{eq:phiFB}
\end{equation}
Observe that $\phi$ is semi-smooth, thus continuous, and that $\phi(a,b)=0$ if and only if $a,b$ are complementary.  For convenience denote $\underline{g}_p = w^J(x_p) - \underline{\gamma}^J(x_p)$ and $\overline{g}_p = \overline{\gamma}^J(x_p) - w^J(x_p)$, the nonnegative gaps at $x_p$.  Now define
\begin{equation}
\rSS(w^J)_p = \begin{cases}
\max\big\{\phi\big(\underline{g}_p, r(w^J)_p\big), \phi\left(\overline{g}_p, -r(w^J)_p\right)\big\}, & x_p \notin \partial_D\Omega, \\
w^J(x_p) - g_D^J(x_p), & x_p \in \partial_D\Omega.
\end{cases} \label{eq:rSS}
\end{equation}
Straightforward modifications apply for unconstrained degrees of freedom, where $\overline{\gamma}^J(x_p) = +\infty$ or $\underline{\gamma}^J(x_p) = -\infty$ or both.

Suppose an iteration starts with $w^{J,0} \in \mathcal{K}^J$, generating (fine-level) iterates $w^{J,k} \in \mathcal{K}^J$.  Let $\id{atol}\ge 0$, $\id{rtol}\ge 0$ be given tolerances.  We employ
\begin{equation}
\|\rSS(w^{J,k})\|_2 < \id{atol} \qquad \text{or} \qquad \frac{\|\rSS(w^{J,k})\|_2}{\|\rSS(w^{J,0})\|_2} < \id{rtol} \label{eq:stoppingcriterion}
\end{equation}
as the stopping criterion.  %A step tolerance, $\|w^{J,k} - w^{J,k-1}\|_2 < \id{stol}$ or similar, could also be used, but for the results in Section \ref{sec:results} we did not find it necessary.

In Section \ref{sec:results} we will show that iteration of the V-cycle Algorithm \ref{alg:fascd}, starting with some finest-mesh initial iterate $w^{J,0}$ and repeated until \eqref{eq:stoppingcriterion} holds, is an effective solver.
However, an F-cycle (Figure \ref{fig:fcycle}), also called a \emph{full multigrid cycle}, is even better.  The well-known principle \cite[section 2.6]{Trottenbergetal2001} is to start on the coarsest mesh and solve the problem from any initial iterate.  Then an admissible initial iterate on the next-finer mesh is generated via prolongation and truncation\pef{Clarify truncation}, and so on.  During this ``ramp'' up one approximately solves on each level by using a fixed number of V-cycles, each down to the coarsest mesh.  From the finest level one does full-depth V-cycles to convergence.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\input{tikz/fcycle.tex}
\end{center}
\caption{F-cycle Algorithm \ref{alg:fascd-fcycle} initially restricts the data $\ell^J,\underline{\gamma}^J,\overline{\gamma}^J$ down to level $j=0$ (gray edges).  Then it prolongs and truncates (doubled edges) to create an admissible initial iterate on the next-finer level.  Solution on each level is by V-cycles. See Figure \ref{fig:fascdvcycle} for the other symbols.}
\label{fig:fcycle}
\end{figure}

This F-cycle approach is described in Algorithm \ref{alg:fascd-fcycle}.  Observe that while injection of the original fine-level constraints $\underline{\gamma}^J, \overline{\gamma}^J$ is \emph{not} used for V-cycles, wherein the LDCs use an existing admissible iterate (Section \ref{sec:cdmultilevel}), when combined with truncation into $\mathcal{K}^j=\{v \in \mathcal{V}^j \,:\, \underline{\gamma}^j \le v \le \overline{\gamma}^j, \, v|_{\partial\Omega} = g_D\}$, injection \emph{is} appropriate for the ramp in an F-cycle\pef{Explain why?}; see lines \ref{line:fcycleprolongtruncone} and \ref{line:fcycleprolongtrunctwo}.  One may generate the coarsest-level initial iterate $w^0\in\mathcal{K}^0$ by injection and truncation down to coarsest level; compare line \ref{line:fcyclecoarsestinitial}.

\begin{comment}
smoother semantics: in our implementation of the V-cycle we actually shift to solve a VI for $\tilde w^j = w^j+y^j$, then compute $y^j = \tilde w^j - w^j$ after the solve, etc.; this is evidently equivalent
\end{comment}

A large space of smoothers could be explored; in Section \ref{sec:results} we apply a fixed number of iterations of the active-set (reduced-space) Newton method from \cite{BensonMunson2006}, the \texttt{VINEWTONRSLS} solver in PETSc \cite{Balayetal2023}, denoted as \emph{RS Newton}.  We use it with a fixed number of preconditioned Krylov iterations to solve the arising linear systems.  For the symmetric Laplacian in Example \ref{ex:results:classical} we apply conjugate gradients (CG) with incomplete Cholesky (IC) preconditioning, but for other operators we apply the generalized minimum residual (GMRES) method with incomplete LU (ILU) preconditioning.  This requires $O(m_j)$ work per iteration. The coarse solver is also RS Newton, but iterated to convergence and with direct solvers applied to solve the arising linear systems.


\section{Results} \label{sec:results}

Algorithms \ref{alg:fascd} and \ref{alg:fascd-fcycle} were implemented in Python using the Firedrake library \cite{Rathgeberetal2016}, allowing $P_1$ or $Q_1$ elements and based on standard nested mesh refinement.  Here we show numerical results for the example problems presented in Section \ref{sec:vi}, with a focus on the scaling of FAScd iterations as the mesh resolution increases.  Our main observations are that each V-cycle dramatically reduces the residual norm, and that very few F-cycles solve most examples to within discretization error.

\begin{example} \label{ex:results:classical}
We consider the unilateral 2D Laplacian obstacle problem presented in Example \ref{ex:plaplacian} with $p=2$ and admissible set $\mathcal{K} = \{v \ge \psi\} \subset W^{1,2}(\Omega)$.  We consider two problems with very different coincidence (active) sets $\{x\in\Omega \,:\, u(x)=\psi(x)\}$, both over square $\Omega$.   The standard ``ball'' problem has an upper hemisphere obstacle $\psi$ \cite[Chapter 12]{Bueler2021}.  In the ``spiral'' problem \cite[Example 7.1.1]{GraeserKornhuber2009}, $\psi$ is constructed to produce a more interesting coincidence set; see Figure \ref{fig:results:classical}.

For this experiment we used a coarsest mesh of $m_0=5^2$ vertices (32 triangles).  The finest mesh had $m_9=2049^2 \approx 4.2 \times 10^{6}$ vertices.  As our smoother we applied a single RS Newton iteration (Section \ref{sec:implementation}), with three (fixed) IC-preconditioned CG iterations to approximately solve the arising linear systems.  The coarse solver was RS$+$LU, iterated to convergence.  Tolerances \texttt{rtol} $= 10^{-6}$ and \texttt{atol} $= 10^{-12}$ were used in stopping criterion \eqref{eq:stoppingcriterion}.  The initial iterate was set to $w=\max\{0,\psi\}$.

Table \ref{tab:results:classical} shows the resulting iteration counts for finest meshes of $m_J$ vertices.  When the RS Newton smoother is applied by itself as a solver (``RS only'') it shows rapidly-increasing iterations as expected, roughly proportional to resolution.  By contrast, V-cycle iterations increase slowly, perhaps logarithmically with the resolution.  Noting that for F-cycles we are counting the number of V-cycles after the ramp (Section \ref{sec:implementation}), we see that a constant number of cycles solves the problem.  Comparing the ball and spiral results, the complexity of the coincidence set or free boundary does not appear to strongly influence FAScd performance \pef{unlike \cite{GraeserKornhuber2009}?}. Each V-cycle does the work of about eight finest-level preconditioned Krylov (CG+IC) iterations; for the F-cycle results, where three iterations suffice at all resolutions, we see close to textbook multigrid efficiency\footnote{Textbook multigrid efficiency is imperfectly defined, but consider \cite{BrownSmithAhmadia2013}: ``an order of magnitude reduction in residual per iteration and solution of the fine-level system at a small multiple of the cost of a residual evaluation.''  Work of less than ten residual evaluations is often mentioned as the standard.} despite the low solution regularity.

\begin{example}  \label{ex:results:plap}
We again consider Example \ref{ex:plaplacian} with a unilateral constraint, but now for the nonlinear $p$-Laplacian. We investigate both fast ($p=1.5$) and degenerate ($p=4.0$) diffusivities.\footnote{``Fast'' and ``degenerate'' refer to $|\grad u|^{p-2}\to \infty$ and $\to 0$, respectively; ellipticity is lost in the latter case.  Well-posedness and ($p$-dependent) solution regularity for $p$-Laplacian obstacle problems is considered in \cite{ChoeLewis1991}.} We consider the problem in one dimension for ease of visualization. This example reveals the sometimes strong contrast between $V(1,0)$ and $V(0,1)$ results (\pr{up}, \pr{down} $=0$ in Algorithm \ref{alg:fascd}, respectively), and it emphasizes the need for robust smoothers.

Let $\Omega=(-3,3)$, $\psi(x) = -0.2|x|$, $\mathcal{K} = \{v \ge \psi\} \subset W^{1,p}(\Omega)$, and $\ell(v) = \int_\Omega g v$ where $g(x)=1$ for $|x|<1$ and $g(x)=-1$ for $|x|>1$.  The exact solution of VI \eqref{eq:vi} is easily computed for any $p$; see Figure \ref{fig:results:plap}. \pef{Write down the exact solution?}  For this experiment we used a coarsest mesh of $m_0=7$ vertices and a finest mesh with $m_9=3073$.  The default smoother uses three (fixed) iterations of RS Newton, with LU solution of the arising linear systems.\footnote{This is an optimal $O(m_j)$ smoother in 1D.}  The coarse solver is the same but iterated to convergence.  The initial iterate was $w=\psi$, and \texttt{rtol} $= 10^{-6}$ and \texttt{atol} $= 10^{-12}$.  Figure \ref{fig:imagesvcycle} illustrates the major steps of an example V-cycle, showing each of the coarse-correction VI subproblems and solutions.

Iteration results are shown in Table \ref{tab:results:fastplap1d} for the fast diffusion $p=1.5$ case.  We see that $V(1,0)$ cycles, essentially Algorithm 4.7 in \cite{GraeserKornhuber2009} but with a stronger smoother, often do not converge.  By contrast, $V(0,1)$ cycles, using only up-smoothing in the larger sets $\mathcal{U}^j$ (Section \ref{sec:cdmultilevel}), are just as good as the default $V(1,1)$ cycles ($=$ Algorithm \ref{alg:fascd}).  F-cycles are even more efficient except when they fail entirely, but these failures arise from singular diffusivity.  If we regularize  $D=|\grad u|^{-0.5}$ to $D_\eps = \left(\eps + |\grad u|^2\right)^{-0.25}$, with $\eps=10^{-8}$, then a single F-cycle suffices at every resolution (column ``F$_\eps$'').

Iteration results for the (unregularized) degenerate diffusion $p=4.0$ case are in Table \ref{tab:results:degenerateplap1d}.  V-cycles using the default settings, specifically three fixed RS Newton iterations, do not converge on the finer meshes; the semi-smooth NCP residual norms \eqref{eq:stoppingcriterion} are unbounded in the failed runs.  Visualization shows an instability in which oscillations in the restricted residuals explode.  However, either a slight increase in smoother power, to four RS Newton iterations, or improved finest-level initial iterates through use of an F-cycle, stops the instability.  Even for the three-iteration smoother, a single F-cycle suffices at every resolution.

The $p=1.5$ and $p=4$ cases give different convergence rates in the $\|\cdot\|_\infty$ norm, namely at rates $O(h^{2.005})$ and $O(h^{1.420})$, respectively; compare \cite{ChoeLewis1991}.

Solvers implemented in Firedrake can exploit parallel solvers from the PETSc library \cite{Balayetal2023}.  The above Examples, run in serial so as to fix the smoother,\footnote{The action of parallel preconditioners can depend on the number of processes \cite[for example]{Bueler2021}.} also run efficiently in parallel.  The next Example applies a parallel solver, and Example \ref{ex:results:sia} demonstrates the parallel weak scaling \cite{Bueler2021} of FAScd.

\begin{example}  \label{ex:results:advdiff}
We consider the advection-diffusion VI problem in Example \ref{ex:advectiondiffusion}.  Let $\Omega=(-1,1)^d$ for $d=2,3$, the diffusivity $\eps=0.1$ (equation \eqref{eq:advectiondiffusionstrong}), and we impose zero Dirichlet boundary conditions.  The 2D problem satisfied the coercivity hypothesis with a divergence-free velocity field $\bX = (7+5y,-5x)$, but in 3D we set $\bX = (7+5y,-5x,2z)$ so $\grad\cdot\bX \ne 0$. \pef{Why?} The discontinuous source term $\phi \in L^\infty(\Omega)$ satisfied $\phi\ge 0$ in half of the domain, with positive circular patches, while values were negative in the other half.  \pef{State where to find the full specification of the source term.} While the other Examples in this Section are unilateral, here the solution was box-constrained: $0 \le u \le 1$.  Figure \ref{fig:results:advdiff} shows coincidence sets for the 2D problem; the 3D sets are comparable in regularity and general pattern.

\label{fig:results:advdiff}
\end{figure}

To minimally-resolve the coincidence set we used a coarse mesh with $m_0=16^d$ vertices.  The 2D solver applied $P_1$ elements and a single processor, but in 3D we used $Q_1$ elements (hexahedra) and $P=16$ processes.  The smoother was two (fixed) RS Newton iterations,  with three preconditioned GMRES iterations to approximately solve the arising linear systems.  The additive Schwarz method (ASM) preconditioner applied incomplete factorization (ILU) preconditioning on each core.  The coarse solver was RS Newton and LU, iterated to convergence.  Tolerances \id{rtol} $=10^{-5}$ and \id{atol} $=10^{-9}$ were used in \eqref{eq:stoppingcriterion}.

F-cycle iteration results are shown in Table \ref{tab:results:advdiff}.  Despite the hint of growing iterations under mesh refinement, a few iterations sufficed up to memory-limited resolutions.  For any of the finer mesh runs here, the FAScd F-cycle solver took less time than generating the $P_1$ mesh hierarchy.  The local Péclet number $\text{Pe}=\|\bX(x,y,z)\|_2 L \eps^{-1}$, with $L=2$ the width of $\Omega$, varied from 40 to 260.  Thus the $m_J\le 121^d$ problems were significantly advection-dominated while those with $m_J\ge 481^d$ were diffusion-dominated.  \pef{I would have said you need $Pe < 1$ to be diffusion-dominated, not have $Pe = 40$?} Nonetheless the smoother was the same and F-cycle iterations were nearly constant.

\begin{example}   \label{ex:results:sia}
We consider the steady shallow ice approximation (SIA) obstacle problem presented in Example \ref{ex:sia}, in which the surface elevation $s$ is constrained to exceed the bedrock elevation $b$.  We set $\Omega=(0,L)^2$ with $L=1800$ km.  The data consist of a radial surface mass balance function $a$ \cite[equation (5.122)]{GreveBlatter2009} and a bumpy, synthetic map $b\in C^1(\Omega)$, with an elevation range of $1800$ m.  A numerical solution is shown in Figure \ref{fig:results:siascene}, colored by the solution surface flow speed, i.e.~the magnitude of $\mathbf{u} = (n+1)(n+2)^{-1} \Gamma (s-b)^{n+1} |\grad s|^{n-1} \grad s$.  As noted in Example \ref{ex:sia}, and seen in this Figure, $|\grad s|$ is unbounded at the free boundary; the solution $s$, while continuous, has very low regularity.

We applied FAScd F-cycles using $Q_1$ elements and a smoother of four (fixed) iterations of RS Newton (Section \ref{sec:implementation}), with quadratic backtracking line search.  The step equations were approximately solved, in parallel, by three (fixed) iterations of preconditioned GMRES, again with a ASM+ILU preconditioner.  The coarse solver was RS Newton with LU applied redundantly over all processors.  The coarse mesh was relatively fine, with $m_0=21^2$ vertices and 400 cells.  Because of the low regularity of the solution we used \id{rtol} $= 2 \times 10^{-4}$ and \id{atol} $= 10^{-8}$ in \eqref{eq:stoppingcriterion}.  The initial iterate was zero ice: $s=b$.

These solver parameters generate a solver with mesh-independent iterations.  Then we fixed the number of degrees of freedom per process at $m_J/P=1281^2 \approx 1.6 \times 10^6$ and solved over $P=1,4,16$ processes.\footnote{Runs were on a single-node workstation with two Intel Xeon 4210 cpus (2.2GHz), a total of 20 physical cores, and 128 GB shared memory.}  The results in Table \ref{tab:results:siaweak} show high-quality weak scaling, that is, nearly-constant run time for mesh refinement under constant $m_J/P$.  The finest mesh result, with $m_J=5121^2=2.6 \times 10^7$ degrees of freedom, needed six minutes to solve for the surface elevation of an ice sheet slightly larger than the current Greenland ice sheet ($1.7$ million $\text{km}^2$) at uniform $350$ m resolution.

\section{Discussion and outlook} \label{sec:discussion}

FIXME the observation that up-smoothing is more efficient seems to be new; compare the comments on V(1,0) and V(1,1) cycles in \cite{GraeserKornhuber2009,Tai2003}

FIXME smoother could be Newton semi-smooth \cite{BensonMunson2006}; smoother could be interior point method, etc.; smoother could use GMG or AMG on step equations but this is not seen to be necessary in applications so far

FIXME the fact that FAScd reduces to FAS for PDEs when inequality constraints are removed (Appendix \ref{app:reductions}) suggests it is a completely different strategy from PFAS in \cite{BrandtCryer1983}

FIXME desired extension to nonlocal variational inequalities not tried here

FIXME For the classical obstacle problem, based on the linear, symmetric Laplacian operator, certain multilevel techniques, such as the truncated monotone multigrid method \cite{GraeserKornhuber2009,Kornhuber1994}, are known to improve performance relative to the original multilevel CD method \cite{Tai2003}.  These improved methods modify the nodal basis functions.  By contrast FAScd makes essentially no assumptions about the FE discretization.  Acceleration via basis-level manipulations is a topic for future research.

\section{Reduction to FAS multigrid for PDEs} \label{app:reductions}

\pr{fascd-vcycle} (Algorithm \ref{alg:fascd}) reduces to the classical FAS multigrid V-cycle for nonlinear PDEs \cite{Trottenbergetal2001}, which itself generalizes linear multigrid, when all inequality constraints are removed.  In fact, suppose we remove the inequality constraints from the finest-level VI problem \eqref{eq:fe:vi} by replacing the finest-level obstacles $\underline{\gamma}^J$ and $\overline{\gamma}^J$ with $-\infty$ and $+\infty$ respectively, thus not constraining the solution $u^J$ or any possible iterate.  The admissible set $\mathcal{K}^J$ of \eqref{eq:fe:vi} is then determined only by the Dirichlet boundary conditions.  Let $\mathcal{V}_0^J \subset \mathcal{V}^J$ denote the linear subspace with zero values on $\partial_D\Omega$.  Since $v-u^J\in\mathcal{V}_0^J$ in \eqref{eq:fe:vi} is now an arbitrary element, we can rewrite the finest-level problem as: find $u^J \in \mathcal{V}^J$ such that
\begin{equation}
\ip{f^J(u^J)}{v} = \ip{\ell^J}{v} \qquad \text{for all } v\in \mathcal{V}_0^J, \label{eq:app:fas:pde}
\end{equation}
the FE discretization of strong-form PDE $f(u)=\ell$.  The downward $\mathcal{D}^j$ and upward $\mathcal{U}^j$ constraint sets are also enlarged so that the corrections $y^j$ and $z^j$ in \pr{fascd-vcycle} are never constrained; lines \ref{line:vcyclegenchifinest}, \ref{line:vcyclegenchi}, and \ref{line:vcyclegenphi} always set $-\infty, +\infty$ by the arithmetic on $\tilde\RR$.
The corrections $y^j$ and $z^j$ are thus unconstrained.

Since the downward/upward VIs \eqref{eq:fe:downvi} and \eqref{eq:fe:upvi} are unconstrained, they can be rewritten as weak forms $\ip{f^j(w^j + y^j)}{v} = \ip{\ell^j}{v}$ and $\ip{f^j(w^j + z^j)}{v} = \ip{\ell^j}{v}$, respectively, for all $v\in \mathcal{V}_0^j$.  Then we combine $u^j=w^j+y^j$, instead of $w^j$ and $y^j$ separately, and similarly $u^j=w^j+z^j$ when up-smoothing.  The smoothers and the coarsest-level solver can be regarded as unconstrained, in-place modifications of $u^j$, so we denote them simply as ``$\text{\pr{smooth}}(\ell^j;u^j)$.''  Noting line \ref{line:vcyclerestrictsolution} of Algorithm \ref{alg:fascd} now says $u^{j-1}=\iR u^j$, after down-smoothing the coarsened source functional computed by line \ref{line:vcyclerestrictell} can be rewritten as
\begin{equation}
\ell^{j-1} = f^{j-1}\left(u^{j-1}\right) + R\left(\ell^j-f^j(u^j)\right). \label{eq:app:fas:levelsource}
\end{equation}

Going upward we must be careful that only the coarse correction, and not the coarse solution, is prolonged \cite[remark 5.3.9]{Trottenbergetal2001}.  After up-smoothing on the $j-1$ level the coarse iterate is $u^{j-1}$, but at this point $u^j=w^j + y^j$ contains the result of $j$th-level down-smoothing.  The initial value of the correction $z^j$, before up-smoothing on the $j$th level, is $z^j = y^j + P z^{j-1}$, where $z^{j-1}$ contains the total correction from coarser corrections and $j-1$ level up-smoothing.  Thus the $j$th-level iterate \emph{before} up-smoothing must be set to
    $$w^j + y^j + P z^{j-1} = u^j + P(u^{j-1} - \iR u^j).$$

Modifying Algorithm \ref{alg:fascd} appropriately, we have a much-simplified Algorithm \ref{alg:fas}.  This FAS V-cycle appears in various sources in the literature, for example \cite[Algorithm 14]{Bruneetal2015} and \cite[section 5.3.4]{Trottenbergetal2001}.

\begin{comment}
%From slack, to not lose

\noindent Patrick : \emph{Interesting that you think Graeser and Kornhuber were barking up the wrong tree.  I still don't quite have my finger on the exact difference in the scheme between GK and the FAS approach. Is there a clean summary somewhere?  (I looked in the mcd-extended manuscript, but couldn't see it in a quick skim.)  Is the difference to GK the monotone multigrid bit, or the particular smoothers used?}

\medskip\noindent
Ed: \cite{GraeserKornhuber2009} only considers the Laplacian lower obstacle case, and they write everything in terms of nonlinear Gauss-Seidel (i.e.~optimize one basis function at a time).  They first lay out the \cite{Tai2003} CD strategy as Alg. 4.7, only for V(1,0) cycles.  Then they observe that the convergence rates from \cite{Tai2003} are slower (worse) than if one does "monotone multigrid".  This seems to mean to them that one modifies the coarse basis functions according to whether they overlap the current fine-grid estimate of the coincidence set, "truncated nodal basis functions".  (See the start of \cite{GraeserKornhuber2009} section 5.2.)  I think that making these modifications in Firedrake, so we could try monotone multigrid V-cycles, would be a nightmare.  FAScd does not attempt the monotone multigrid idea at all.

By contrast, FAScd is essentially just the \cite{Tai2003} CD strategy, but (1) without assuming an objective, and (2) with a coarse correction which is FAS in the nonlinear PDE case.  If you apply \cite{Tai2003} CD to a nonquadratic (e.g. p=1.5 p-laplacian) objective then the coarse-grid corrections are optimization problems over the coarse space.  I don't even know how to interpret this in non-optimization VIs?  Or maybe I should say that one can re-interpret this as FAS coarse corrections, and I have done so.

But I have now concluded that everything discussed in \cite{GraeserKornhuber2009} is angels-on-the-head-of-a-pin stuff because the various differences of implementation don't produce any really good multigrid convergence if your smoother is NGS on each level.  I think the convergence proofs in \cite{GraeserKornhuber2009} all depend on this?  There are indeed differences in convergence rates reported in the results at the end of \cite{GraeserKornhuber2009}, but they are all not good compared to how multigrid works on PDEs.  This NGS-based stuff is what I was trying before February, in 1d mostly, with hand-made NGS smoothers, and no Firedrake.

Now, the good thing I was already doing before February was building a version of VI multigrid which makes minimal assumptions on the problem:  FAS (residual need not be linear) and CD (build-up the total V-cycle update in an admissible manner on every level).  Thus it has a chance of working for the ice problems I care about.

As I now see, and can easily demo on the spiral problem in \cite{GraeserKornhuber2009} and on any other classical obstacle problem I have tried, the thing which makes it fly is to realize, as you did, or perhaps as you just take for granted because you are so comfortable with Firedrake, that the smoother can be a grown-up but still O(N) VI solver.  E.g.~a fixed number of iterations of vinewtonrsls+gmres+ilu or whatever.  The role of the FAScd is simply to generate coarse VI problems which, once solved, make helpful admissible additions to the eventual V-cycle update.

So the difference between FAScd and \cite{GraeserKornhuber2009} are: (1) FAS coarse corrections, (2) no attempt to do monotone/truncated multigrid which would be a mess (I think) across the FE infrastructure, (3) clarity on what sets you can use in $V(\nu_1,\nu_2)$ cycles, with bigger up-smoother sets in particular, and most importantly (4) implementation within the mature Firedrake/PETSc library framework where one can easily hook up an active-set Newton step as a smoother.
