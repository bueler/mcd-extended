"""Solve Bratu equation in 1D by FAS multigrid:
   -u'' - lambda e^u = f(x)
with Dirichlet conditions u(0)=u(1)=0 and
   f(x) = 9 pi^2 sin(3 pi x) âˆ’ lambda exp(sin(3 pi x)).
The exact solution of this problem is u(x) = sin(3 pi x).

The goal is to solve the same problem as in
    Bueler (2021) "The full approximation storage multigrid scheme:
    A 1D finite element example", arXiv:2101.05408.
Specifically to start, compare to:
    ./fas1.py -K 1 -mms -niters 1 -cyclemax 1 -show

Weak form is
    F(u)[v] = ell[v]
where v is a test function and
    F(u)[v] = ( dot(grad(u), grad(v)) - lambda * exp(u) * v ) * dx
    ell[v] = f * v * dx

Solver is FAS V-cycles.  Going downward the V-cycle uses solve() for a
down-smoother, forms the FAS correction equation, and decrements the level.
The coarsest problem is solved by LU.  Going upward the V-cycle prolongs and
adds the computed correction and then uses solve() as an up-smoother.  The
smoother is a fixed number of Newton iterations with a fixed number of GS sweeps.
(FIXME: backward GS on up?)

The FAS correction equation is
    Fc(uc)[vc] = ellc[vc]
where Fc has same formula as F and
    ellc[vc] = R'(resf)[vc] + Fc(R(uf))[vc]
and
    resf[v] = ellf[v] - Ff(uf)[v]
and R' is canonical restriction and R is injection.  After solution the fine
level iterate is updated
    u <- u + P(uc - R(uf))
where P is prolongation.
